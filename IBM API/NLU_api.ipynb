            "friendly reminder that stress and depression and anxiety have effects on your memory and the way you experience time also my first first first advice is see a therapist when you re able to and don t think that you re weird or unusual because that s happening to you this is a side effect of a sickness that you have depression like any other sicknesses edit to add after i recovered from my first major depressive episode i didn t have a personality anymore like what kind of person was i what kind of things did i like nothing i had to find out build out those things again i vividly remember telling this to a friend and him telling me you re a decent person and a smart person if this is happening to you it s happening to a lot of other people too you re not the first this had strangely comforted me like knowing that this wasn t a weird thing i was doing to myself or that i was failing at that was my fault you know same applies to you you re not alone in this and it s not your fault\n",

            "honestly same i have almost no long term memory at all i can only remember little vague things beyond 2 weeks ago\n",
            "me too this happened to me at 16 and damn i miss my old self so much i ve kind of dissociated who i am now its weird\n",
            "this is part and parcel with growing up trust me i ve been through some shit in my time i had no feelings for years and i was angry confused deeply depressed unmotivated lacking empathy and always going in circles feeling lost in complete darkness but i know for a fact regardless of how you feel now that part you seek is still inside you it just needs to be brought into focus and maybe those fragmentary memories will become clearer so just dredge up the will power and ignite that spark of nature within you learn to cut out bad habits if you have any whatever they may be drinking playing games too long eating shit all the time hanging around the wrong people and if your male for goodness sake stop masturbating so frequently it drains the life out of men adopt a physical activity listen to some calming music and take advantage of the natural world and most of all learn to breathe properly meditate\n",
            "damn i really feel this i ve had anxiety and depression since i was 14 now 21 and over the years it s like my brain is slowly deteriorating my anxiety evolved into panic disorder multiple phobias and ocd my depression has only gotten worse and my memory and concentration is completely fucked it really feels like mental illness is like the cancer of the psyche\n",

            "oh yeah everyone keeps saying it gets better once i finally got some meds to make me a bored zombie i decided to just fake it help other people be happy since i seemingly never will be i figure it couldn t hurt maybe i can help others who feel like shit plus i could always use the brownie points with the big guy i d much prefer to head upstairs even though i basically gave up the gift of life years ago the best idea i ve had so far is to just try not to get worked up and blow through life on zombie mode comfortably knowing that every single day is one day closer to the end good or bad it s finally over and i didn t cause a living hell for the people i care about\n",
            "it s like i died at 12 years old i m now 23 it s been a battle i ve never worked for more than 6 months at a time at 18 i stopped self harming though so that s good but the lazy comments from ppl never go away i went to school for esthetics and i don t have the energy or confidence to work in the industry i feel like a failure oh and did i mention my depression is medication resistant does it get better\n",
            "i get what you mean i m 17 but it feels like my brain gave up years ago just about when i started my teen years and from then its only been a slow descent down with very few highs someone told me part of it could be depersonalization when i once mentioned how often i look at my own hands or my feet when im walking and i m convinced they aren t mine like my brain doesn t recognize my own body for whatever reason s i wish you the best as someone who knows a similar hell to go through just know you aren t the only one who feels similar\n",
            "my friend it feels you ve in a way put my own reality into words i don t know how old you are now but you re still here you ve got a 100 track record of making it through the shitty times you re a winner things will get better\n",
            "i ve been feeling the exact same way since i was 13 i have absolutely no memories from before that age im 18 now and there s so many gaps in my memory from even last year i don t even know how it feels to be happy\n",
            "it s horrible i know it s like your brain can t keep up with life but your body is forced to the worst part is nobody can tell please remember stranger that you are more than just a body with a head or the other way round i am incredibly grateful for your existence you might be helping so many people right now you could be making the slightest difference in someone s life you re really brave it s nice to confess how you feel you re not alone be nice to yourself be kind the words you tell yourself become your home it has to get worse before it gets better it hurts before it heals keep ya head up 3\n",

            "i m actually really surprised that there are lots of you who have felt this same feeling that i ve felt i m only 4 months into a possible shift towards feeling alive at 35 but i m still treading the waters of depression anxiety a whole lot of self doubt the last 20 years have been lost in fact i miss being a teen so much that i still find myself preferring the things i liked at that time not in a regressive way but because it s what makes me feel alive happy\n",
            "i originally posted this as a reply to another comment but i tought i d post it here too get help i know it s hard to take that first step but please try and don t give up until you have a treatment plan don t be afraid of antidepressants you might have to tray a few different ones because of side effects etc that s normal i can t stress enough that you do not want to live with untreated depression i did that for over 20 years and since getting treatment i have realized how fucking stupid that was there is value in living and the only thing telling you otherwise is your illness be honest with youself and those who are close to you and be open about your illness it s okay to be mentally unwell and depression is very easy to treat for me 20 years of depression and self destructiveness ended with fluoxetin\n",
            "i stopped living at around 16 i m 22 right now but i cannot for the life of me recall what all i ve done in the past 6 years everyone i meet assumes that i m still in school my parents are always telling me that i stopped growing after school jokingly of course but it s never funny to me because it s actually true\n",
            "that s common with dissociating i dissociate when i m feeling really depressed or anxious it feels like i m watching myself live life but it s not really happening to me\n",
            "17 was when i broke testifying apparently broke me according to every doctor and hospital that ever treated me disassociation was something i learned very early now life feels like auto pilot as positive as i try to be especially now having to care for another my biggest delusion was thinking i succeeded at my suicide attempt as was now being punished for with this existence assuming it was some form of purgatory i don t believe that now of course but it made sense at the time\n",

            "sane dude also felt dead inside since i was 15 and it only got worse over time\n",
            "died at 24 here and am now 34 that s not when my depression began but it s when my life went so far off track it s doubtful i ll ever be able to recover\n",
            "personally i feel like i ve been dead inside for 5 years before 2015 my whole life was filled with pain and agony so feeling nothing is better than suffering i guess\n",

            "i m not sure if it s the same but i m now 21 and when i was 16 i became anxious and depressed now 5 years on still with anxiety depression and most of my memories are gone from my past my therapist told me this can happen from being low for so long i hate it it makes me feel stupid but i feel like it was my brains way of trying to block out all the bad stuff but it s also blocked out all the good stuff\n",

            "i feel the same thing i feel like that since 16 the person before that time seems someone else it is someone else but instead of growing toward the future my head is stuck in that faraway past hoping that i ll feel like that again although i kind even remember what being happy feels like\n",
            "yes but it s not related to depression it s a part of growing up the transition for others might ve included depression though like me looking forward for a new checkpoint\n",

            "you aren t alone depression takes the color out of everything it clouds judgement and makes the worst option seem like the best one most times to no fault of your own finding purpose is especially hard because every option just seems unappealing or unattainable if i were to reccomend anything to remedy this just pop some music in and let your thoughts go for a while observe them some of them may be self loathing and what helps me with those sort of thoughts is to ask myself is that true more than likely the answer is no if you take an onjective look at it i can only wish you well on the rest of your life i hope you can find some color warmth emotion anything other than the hollowness you might be feeling right now\n",
            "i was 13 when i died inside i m now 21 died once more today when my crush rejected me why do i live\n",

            "me too i died when i first became depressed almost ten years ago i can t remember most of my childhood i don t consider my child self and my current self the same person we re too different i don t know what it s like to be happy to have hope in the future i m not dead but i m definitely not alive either i m a zombie\n",
            "i stopped living senior year of high school i went crazy with freedom and was partying every weekend leaving school halfway through the day without permission gave no fucks about classes took no control over my finances and didn t re register my car after it had somehow expired within a few months i was so high on life and marijuana then my car was impounded and i had a criminal charge for being caught with a bong this was that summer a week before i was going away to college my parents basically said no i think i just broke and i completely fucked up my second chance at community college and now jobs corps seems like my only shot at a decent future only through blood and sweat will i ever get back to school point of the story is i died somewhere along the way kept fucking up my life not going in any one direction and completely pissing away all of my money while desperately trying to maintain a weed habit i fucked myself fuck life the beggar can no longer be the chooser my fate will be determined by what opportunities i m able to take advantage of whenever they come up these days very uncertain fuck it all\n",
            "i kind of feel that i think its part of the human condition its interesting to ask of course what makes us alive the body or our brain memories etc and what happens when the 2 are not in sync or one exists without the other but then again if free will does not exist and things are simply a chain of cause and effect was this doomed to happen all along is there anything we can do about this or is our fate already decided what makes a life worth living and find those things that make it worth living because even if you fail and perhaps failure was destined all along at least you tried your best and that can have intrinsic meaning if you believe in it although the choice is yours\n",
            "when i mentally died i was afraid i didn t know what to do i just turned 18 and i didn t know what was going to happen in life i m 26 i ve learned to accept that i m mentally gone and i ve been feeling better there s days where i feel like i ve mentally came back to life and then proceed to have a panic attack because i was having an existential crisis hahaha but not everyone has the same life or goes through the same thing do small things that bring even the littlest joy to you even a small goal like reorganize your clothes or do 15 jumping jacks it s not a cure but sometimes you can enjoy the little things in life that are still there and not completely gone\n",
            "i honestly don t even know when i stopped it s like i just faded into nothing\n",
            "i m 21 soon and till 10th grade i was just existing and then i took effort a to change myself and i m kinda doing way better than i used to enjoy the ups and downs it s not fall that kills you its the landing perspective of taking your downsides\n",

            "i stopped living i feel when i was 17 1 2 putting in all my effort graduating high school in 11th grade i dropped all my friends within months after at 18 i dated a girl we had a 2 year serious relationship i wasn t working or anything just doing me and flowing with the relationship we broke up 2 months ago and still here i am just flowing the only difference is now not someone to hang out with and talk to daily even if i get back on track and in society and everything i think my isolation and not being part of society for like 3 years has done a permanent toll on me\n",
            "it feels like you re not living life like we all supposed to i felt the same way but of different perspective to yours i feel like a lifeless puppet just to fullfil my own part in life it feels like a dream a second you were in highschool blink you re an adult filled with responsibilities and fullfil your duty which no one even you likes or enjoy doing it i hope one day to leave the world but seeing how it pains me to leave my love ones it hit me everyday if i didn t born wouldn t they be happy since i wasn t in their lives i didn t save their lives or give helpful advice like a sage i just do the same old labour cleaning cooking and study i d feel the burden of strings attached me getting heavier and tighter with every fiber of my body never in a single day that i missed to pray to god to take my life away in my sleep but to wake up every morning to still be alived but disappointed that i still breath instead of not it runs automatically everyday bath eat work etc repeat i interpret that life is a curse not a gift just to toil and work even though mankind reach the epitome of tech advancement better than back then we still suffer the dread misery of this very existence yet some of us don t want to leave because of the fear of the unknown but then again we still look forward to it cuz we could rest peacefully without a care of the world\n",
            "same here i m just waiting for my death the only thing that brings me joy is weed but only because it stops me a little bit from overthinking\n",

            "i m quite envious you ve even lived that long i died at 10 maybe my soul went to heaven but my body and mind are still stuck in this perpetuating hell the worst part is nobody will ever understand it s acceptable to believe an adult has depression but a child none the less a prepubescent one is just unfathomable to anyone who s never had depression what do you mean you feel like you died when you were 10 you were still young there s no way you were that unhappy yeah thanks now go tell that to the 10 year old that tried to kill themself and hasn t felt any joy since\n",
            "dude it s like 12 was the last time i was happy and the last time i felt like i was actually alive you re not alone at all\n",

            "this is exactly how i feel it s like i ve been a ghost for years now i understand\n",
            "i think this happened to me when i was 12 14 now i just play video games every day because i feel empty\n",
            "15 was the worst fucking age i ve ever been that was when i started to get depression on and off due to being an awkward mess\n",
            "it s so hard to grow up nowadays life is a ducking trip i think about death way to much i kinda just wanna relapse and do heroin and be homeless again forever\n",

            "i definetly feel like i ve died at 15 too i m really just sick of everything too\n",
            "i felt that for over 12 years and it is something that i still have to battle with to this day the days that i want to do nothing are the days that i force myself to do something we can not control how we feel but we can control what we do reward yourselves for good things and work towards a life that will lead you out of this it is not easy but it gets easier\n",
            "i kinda feel like i stopped living at 17 all my friends went to different unis while i didn t make it so i had to repeat a year now i m 19 in isolation just playing video games and waiting for results for exams which i didn t sit but success is never a straight line as they say\n",

            "my father died when i f24 was 12 and since then i feel like i ve been waiting for something to happen just dragging myself through all these years as if i hit a pause button on life i feel you\n",
            "i know i m late on this but this really sits with me it s a constant thought in my mind i would say i first started feeling this way around 17 when i had a couple of heartbreaks and my relationship with my parents became more toxic when i was trying to heal from past things it felt like time had nothing to deal with the hurt they brought it kind of made me numb in a way where i did lose myself and the years kept coming with nothing to really show it s quite depressing\n",
            "these past couple years i ve have been the worst i can t remember anything and it s like i ve been living another life\n",

            "same here i had some interesting experiences when i was 15 that i haven t fully bounced back from but at the same time i feel like it made me into a better person in some ways i feel like i ve been dying slowly for the last couple of years both inside and out life keeps giving me gifts then taking them from me and kicking me in the balls things have proceeded to get worse one phase of my life out ghettos the next and so on i m really sorry to hear you feel like that i wish you well as feeling like that is no way to live at all good luck\n",

            "i myself died at 16 now i am only left with obligations and responsibilities of my family i have no dreams i am just fulfilling the dreams of my family and society of waking up eating going to my job that i landed in because everybody did it so i should also be doing it to make me look normal i am a software developer by the way coming back home and then back to bed i live in a city well after all this it made me realize i want peace more than money love from people more than their expectations from me and support and freedom about what i actually want more than appreciations for doing everything so well i wish to live in the country sides in the mountains where it is mostly cloudy with simple people and my family i want to do a simple job like tutoring children or working at an animal husbandry or working as a librarian or working with something related to nature i don t care about the money i want to make friends with these countryside people and want to talk about simple minimalistic things i have no big dream seriously and i am not ashamed of it basically having a simple life is my biggest dream that according to society can t be accepted as actually a dream\n",

            "i feel exactly this and exactly age 15 too like if my body died it wouldn t be too sad because what is inside is already dead and what s still breathing is just a husk my memories beyond age 18 have been kinda muddled at first i thought all the lithium fcked my brain up but then i realized if every day is the same old misery of going through the motions there s not much to remember\n",
            "i can relate to an extent i don t always feel like i m not living but i get to points where i do so it s like parts of my life don t really exist it could be a day week or even last a few months\n",

            "i can relate to this i feel like i died when i was 14 the only things i can remember are the things that bring me pain and self hatred i kinda feel like my brain just stopped functioning after that i can hardly remember things that happen to me or even the stuff i learned at college it s like i m trapped in a dead body but i m still living at the same time\n",
            "i did so many drugs one day wasn t thinking lost my girl my job and the worst of all my emotions feel dull i want to have a connection with someone more specifically a s o that i actually love but as of now i cant even feel love at all even friend interactions when i do have them are unfulfilling to me all i do is workout smoke weed try and sleep and repeat im doing the literal best i can and its not enough but only time will heal in my case its just a waiting game\n",
            "yup died at 15 as well now stuck in a body that continues to function and survival instincts fear that prevent me from jumping of a building or cliff\n",
            "since 15 9 years i didnt made one friend since then and no reason to mention had no girlfriend since then despite looking atleast normal constantly numb unsatisfied extreme anxiety i cant think clearly bad grades etc the worst time started with meditation it got me in a state where i feel like im not myself numb emotionless and completely unlikeable i cant get out of that weird state therapists didnt really got it and paychotropic drugs didnt helped and made me afraid like i lose myself even more\n",
            "i m only 14 and want to die school is litterally killing me on the inside and i ve tried to kill myself once just please keep on trying to be happy i know its sucky but we all gotta try to get over this mountain of shit\n",

            "i died at 16 on the same day as my birthday it ll be two years ago in january i don t remember who i was before then and i miss them they died and now what s replaced them is passively suicidal depressed and anxiety ridden parody i hate my life and it feels like i ran out of options a long time ago\n",
            "this would be called persistent depressive disorder i am not diagnosing you but i say look into it this is exactly what i was diagnosed with along with c ptsd and it sucks because i feel like i m not sick enough sure i may go days without showering and brushing my teeth i have crying episodes and i self harm suicidal ideations totally there but i also go to school go out with friends i have good grades and pass all my classes and like you i feel like i m living a double life there s been this desire in me lately one of just escaping either through death or through moving to another state but there s just this intense desire to get away and i think that s where it stems from i won t lie i suffer from an identity crisis i genuinely don t know who i really am i ve spent my whole life conforming to everyone s standards just to please them anyways op i hope you re able to overcome this to whatever extent possible we all deserve a chance at true happiness\n",
            "exactly me i feel like i m living a triple life the mask real me dead me\n",
            "i feel ya i feel like it s the anxiety that makes us high functioning i don t say anything here most times because i wish i could go about not caring about things it s tiring and i just want to do things i see need i want to be done but i feel like i literally can t like yeah this relatively simple thing that i should be able to do can t do it and can t tell you why or i can tell you but you ll see me differently and it won t be about me feeling this way it ll be about why don t i just do it and stop being silly sometimes the facade slips and i ll be busy thinking about something innocuous or walking along literally thinking of nothing or i m just tired or strained and people will be asking what s up or why do i look sad i mean of all the times you could ask that you ask at my most neutral when i have none of my invading thoughts\n",
            "i have the same feeling i can relate sometimes only you know what you re going through\n",
            "i couldn t agree more man i have days where i can just go with the flow and smile as if it s all fine not stress about every little answer to people and other days i m just a plague of antisocialism where i don t even wanna speak to a soul\n",
            "almost every day this year i would come home from work go straight to my bed and lie awake thinking about ways to kill myself until i fell asleep i finally cracked and asked my mom to help find me a short term care facility instead she set up some psychiatrist appointments and helped me coordinate care with my therapist been on effexor and haven t felt that way since recovery is possible don t give up ask for help small tasks like cooking and cleaning can feel monumental but if you have someone that can lend a hand it will go a long way\n",
            "you know that whole thing where some of the best comedians have horrible depression now that i work in a customer service job i totally get it at work i am the man people love me i m funny energetic and caring i have customers requesting me i get home and its a totally different world\n",
            "had a classmate say that she thinks i m really smart but i replied by saying that i m good at giving off the illusion that i m smart i just don t handle compliments well enough because i refuse to believe them maybe i m being too hard on myself but at the end of the day i just don t see anything worth liking about myself\n",
            "i live out the exact same scenario as you everyday i make everyone laugh at work i m dedicated and relied upon i contribute new ideas and help to implement them if feasible im a rockstar at work for 40 hours a week then i go home to a lonely apartment and ponder the rationale of my continuing on i go to work the next day donning my mask again everyone likes me but no one on the planet loves me\n",
            "i have all those of a high functioning person with the added drawback of having persistent suicidal thoughts and ideas i m high functioning but feel i ll never be good enough so i try more to receive validation from others most days i m tired trying to keep it up i m sore from beating myself up and i m acutely suicidal at least once a week for the last 10 20 years with 7 attempts so far despite all this i m turned away from receiving help i m lucky enough to get at least 1 therapist appointment a month i don t qualify for group therapy and on the outside most people think i m faking it i m highly aware of what s going on around me but unable to change into a positive direction\n",
            "i hear what you are saying i m considered smi seriously mentally ill i suffer from deep depression extreme anxiety ptsd and chronic insomnia due to the trauma i am a 38 year old student at a large university where i take 15 credits a semester to graduate early i hand in my homework on time i have all a s in my classes and i haven t missed a single class people look at me and think i m just typical what they don t know is i m on the verge of crying most days i m extremely tired all the time but i pretend to be fine even with my friends no one knows what i suffer from and how i feel\n",
            "i relate to this a lot but the worst bit is that this is the kind of thing where people accuse you of not being depressed and just being sad a lot of people seem to have this conception that if you can get out of bed take care of yourself shower brush your teeth go to work that you re not depressed at all that couldn t be further from the truth i like to be open with the fact i take antidepressants and attend weekly therapy because i want to own my depression not shy away from or be afraid to mention it but you d be surprised how many people just go oh you don t seem that bad what goes on in your head can be a million miles away from how you act in front of people\n",
            "are you getting any help for this even though we don t talk about high functioning depression on this sub a lot it s really serious i lived with dysthymia for years before it turned into double depression then i finally got it treated when i finally went on meds i discovered a kind of calmness i didn t even know existed i didn t know life without high functioning depression this sort of depression is more persistent and can be harder to treat than major depression please get help you deserve better\n",
            "i have the same feeling most people would honestly be shocked if i told them about having even a little depression let alone the amount of sadness i feel on the daily\n",
            "same here only in my deepest depression i can no longer maintain the facade so i m visibly glum struggling to concentrate at work unable to keep up appearances and on the verge of breaking down publicly but am still forcing myself to go to work and be relatively high functioning basically i can t afford to be non functional i wouldn t get out of bed if i didn t have to i know it s fucked up but in a way i m kind of jealous of people who are non functional because that s how i feel but i have to maintain the horrible routine\n",
            "dude i related so much here is a recommendation for you that i use music that s the therapy i use without music i wouldn t be alive\n",
            "i m in the same exact situation i can clearly see that the way i relate to my life is not normal yet it s so difficult to change the way i feel what i ve tried to do is focus on changes and actions that i see as meaningful to myself it s key that i live for me and what makes me happy\n",
            "however i feel like i am hidden behind a veil and when i come home from work and when i am in the privacy of my home i am in such crippling depression i have such terrible episodes of sadness this is my life for the last several months summarized for me it is college classes instead of work but i don t even have the energy these days to go to them the last lecture i attended was in august this year i hate myself i over analyze everything stupid i do or say throughout the day and i replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself that sounds like anxiety i used to have this though it wasn t much just a little social anxiety my depression got so bad that i just stopped caring about everything including what others think about anything which made me stop over analyzing everything and my social anxiety went away the only good thing that happened to me because of depression i don t feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don t know why anyone even likes me totally i just feel like i didn t do anything special anyone could ve done the same if they had just given it enough time i attribute all my success to just have happened by chance those good things happened to me just because i kept showing up and not because i did anything special it s like i ve been cheating my parents and close friends by not telling them all this\n",
            "i am currently sitting in the parking lot of my job i walked out of our office party i can t take it i just want to be alone and i don t wanna talk to these ppl until recently they all thought i was super friendly they ve now learned otherwise i just had to leave so i could go cry for a while i m sorry u feel that way i m 2 different ppl too 2 very very different ppl\n",
            "i relate to this so much i also feel like when i do slip and need help i dont get taken very seriously as im functioning sometimes id happily fall asleep if i knew i wouldnt wake back up\n",
            "you re not alone i have suffered from episodes of depression for many years since my first serious episode when i was 19 but have usually been able to manage it and push through until it passes about 5 years ago i started sliding into a place i haven t seen since i was 19 and i can t seem to get out i m middle aged married kids successful educated professional in a high status locally anyway job no financial problems very little debt at this stage own my home nothing from the outside looks bad but inside i m hollowed out it s all rusted gears and rot like the guts of an antique clock you keep around just fpr show at work i continue to perform i still take on the big projects that they think they need me for i still get results get compliments win promotions at home i screw on the mask for my children i ve tried to tell my wife what s really going on inside me but she doesn t can t won t understand she just tells me i need to go out with friends more and find a fun hobby thing is i do go out with friends but it exhausts me trying to be sociable when all i want to do some days is die i have hobbies but i can t enjoy them because they just frustrate me when things are bad and i end up feeling worse not every day is completely bad sometimes i can fake it long enough to push through and actually experience some fun some happiness but then i need to deal with the crash i know will come after but the bad days are really bad yesterday i faked it through an important meeting and then locked myself in a meeting room and fought down the sobs for half an hour lately self harm has been back on the table sometimes i ll move through hours feeling like i m trapped in amber or it s all unreal totally dissociating i know and this is me on meds and with a counsellor\n",
            "my god i m so happy i found this post this describes me to a t i mean wow i have no friends to talk to so i come to social media sites to talk to strangers i don t know thank you for sharing this\n",
            "why do you hate yourself it sounds like you re living a good life so you must be doing something you hate\n",
            "i feel the exact same way however i don t care for my job although it is stable i hate what i do but i am the exact same i go in and act like everything is great and i am happy i put on a face and try to get to know people and form relationships yet i go home everyday and die inside i hate my life and what i do and i also overanalyze everything i do so i completely understand i think what this comes down to is that you have high confidence at work but low self esteem so when you go home at night all of those doubts about yourself come rushing out after a day of interacting you need to work on your self esteem as do i you obviously have a lot of ability and you are capable but you need to have a good self esteem base and love yourself to get through this and move passed hating yourself and what you do there are lot of self help books out there and talks that people have given on this not sure if youve looked into anything like that but you really should you need to learn to remove the negative self talk\n",
            "i feel you man i m the same and honestly quite sick of people either not believing in depressed or believing i am some sort of bipolar that invariably said as it s not that bad you have also manic periods where you can accomplish a lot people all i have are negative thoughts cit sigh\n",
            "i can relate to this i have been depressed for 5 years now but it doesn t affect my schoolwork and other aspects as much that s why when i open up to someone about it they are usually in disbelief when someone reported to my professor behind my back that i might be suicidal he called me to his office and talked to me about it one thing he said really hit me he said what worries me a lot is that interacting with you for so long during staff meetings i never would have thought that you re going through this you seem totally fine happy even so how will i know if you re indeed alright or you just seem alright to me but you actually need help\n",
            "it s hard maintaining the happy persona especially in work i work in retail so it s all smiles smiles smiles a few colleagues have described me as sunshine and while i m glad my sadness doesnt show through i just wish someone could know and understand how i actually feel obviously that cant really happen unless i open up to someone which i really dont want to have to do over compensating for feeling sad by acting happy is super duper common among depressed people sometimes i think even those close to me think i m exaggerating how i feel but i honestly wouldn t do say or act the way i do if i wasnt in the midst of depressive episodes it s tough i feel for everyone here i hope yall are managing and at least have some form of support from someone you deserve it even if you seem happy on the outside\n",
            "the work put into pretending to be ok has to be one of the most exhausting jobs i have\n",
            "this is totally valid and honestly really common you deserve to seek professional help from a psychiatrist and a therapist just as much as any of us everybody deserves the chance to be happy there is no such thing as not sick enough\n",

            "yea when it first started i showed it a lot and my friends helped me and now i hide it entirely and some think i was just faking it for attention which really sucks since its been getting worse this girl i m friends with cares about me a lot but doesn t like me back and i feel like i annoy and burden her when i tell her how i feel despite her saying that i m not burdening her my grades are slowly falling and i can t get myself to do anything im just slowly watching aspects of my life disappear\n",
            "i can so relate to that except for two instances in my life i was always highly functional in my career i appeared to have it all together on the outside but my soul was crumbling inside all of this got better when i lived more authentically when i started sharing who i really am to my surprise this didn t make people run away but a lot of people felt closer than ever before all of this through making myself more vulnerable and the side effect i guess was that i learned to accept my sharp edges more i get more purpose and didn t feel as disconnected putting a mask on every day makes you feel disconnected from others and i am sure that this is a major component of you feeling down when you are not at work does that resonate at all\n",
            "i feel the same except i have no friends and nobody likes me my job is depressing demotivating and demanding i ve lost sight of who i am and where i wanna be in life i feel like my body is on auto pilot doing the most so that i dont have to think or feel anything i dont know if i m depressed or really sad all i know is that i ve never been happy i don t have anyone to talk to or confide in i literally have no friends i really don t know what is my life at this point guess i m kinda just waiting to die\n",
            "i can relate what helps me is focusing on my problems and trying to solve them as well as a bit of ignorance here and there to reduce overthinking it s not easy and i hope you find genuine happiness as well as genuine saddens the one without depression\n",
            "i totally relate i have a very stressful and physical job that requires me to be able to multi task and always be in control i love to make others laugh and use humour as a coping mechanism as well i reach out to those at work customers and co workers but rarely get anything back my mask and costume are so good that people think i m sooooooo strong etc but yet inside i m crumbling i speak openly about my depression and that i ve struggled for 30 years but besides my doctor who helps me with my meds and does a great job listening when i know i need an adjustment i am still alone and struggling i often feel that if i wasn t here no one would miss me or think about me sad but true\n",
            "how are you able to work and do work i have high functioning depression but at the same time i don t even do my work so i guess it s medium functioning lol\n",
            "me too exactly the same there are many of us but it s very hard thank you for sharing your experience and it has helped me on a bad day today to know that i m not alone in this i wish you well\n",
            "how do you see outside of yourself i feel like if i could do that i would be cured of my depression\n",
            "this is probably the post i ve related to the most ever i live my life and i hate every moment of it but i just keep going lately i ve been wondering why can t i just be happy why does everything i do feel like i m just doing it to meet others standards to just do what i m expected of without any enjoyment i over analyze over think and struggle every day yet i keep getting up and doing it over and over and over again i want to run away or just die but then i d make other sad i just wish there was a way to go just one day without feeling like garbage\n",
            "its what i was for years when i finally went to the doc was diagnosed major clinical depression saw a crappy counselor because i was mr know it all i didn t fully accepted her to help me and i struggled along the way medication helps alot you feel emotions that you ve forgotten to feel don t let the years pass you by as a robot you are at least aware n do sumthin about it now\n",
            "i feel you i ve felt that way for as long as i can remember more than ten years recently i spiraled and people around me started seeing and experiencing the cracks in my pretense which made me feel worse because i find it s unfair to them i hope you find strength to go for treatment it may not always work hell it may even make you feel worse but personally i thought it was the best shot i could give myself and a way of not burdening people around me with my dark thoughts that they ve never seen from me and probably aren t ready to handle\n",
            "absolutely relate to this remember all those quizzes people would take before social media was a thing and it was things like what type of weather are you or what animal are you or where is your perfect vacation any of those that ask you personality questions and give you an answer based on what you say i always would think okay am i answering as my depressed self or as my default happy self it s so difficult\n",
            "i can somewhat relate to you although not completely i d put this facade i thought i wouldn t be able to till i m actually on my way to present myself to the public world in general and i didn t realise that till now as you are articulating it in your post the way i speak carry myself and dressed wouldn t give you the impression that i have depression in fact i m always surprised to realise that i have depression after being detached and numb for so long once i look at myself in the mirror as i unwind for the night\n",
            "i feel the exact same way now my life might not be as stable i make sure to act like it is around friends then when i m around people i joke and like making people laugh but the moment everyone leaves and i m alone it s like a night and day shift it feels like i m two different people too so you re not alone in this\n",
            "i m just a normal guy when i step on campus but once i sit down in my room hell\n",
            "i m in the same boat you re not alone it s more than possible for someone to be in the throes of terrible depression but still be able to function everyone has this picture of a depressed person as someone isolating themselves in a dark room not bathing or caring for themselves and crying non stop in reality depression can look like anything\n",
            "i wouldn t say that it s equally horrible perhaps subjectively all pain is equal but objectively one is a worse type of suffering than the other and i say this as someone who has been feeling quite good lately\n",
            "thats 100 me i feel this post so bad only some close friends and family members know about my depression\n",
            "i can relate to this so much i work in a small business so all the employees are close i actually opened up to one about suffering from depression and she was shocked she had no idea considering i hide it so well medication makes it manageable but still does not undo all the toxic thoughts that become habitual after going untreated for so many years being functional does not mean it doesn t hurt it just hurts differently\n",
            "feel this too i actually used work as a distraction from everything else for a while it s funny because people will call you hard working when for me the reality was and still is that all i am able to do is get to work i can barely get out of bed for anything else eventually i got burnt out at work too and now everything feels like a struggle but i still have that facade going\n",
            "hey friend i just wanna say i hope you find some help because you are valid and you matter i m not as high functioning as you are i can t hold a job at all but because i don t self harm or get physical when i m in a downwards spiral i get overlooked i ve finally found a therapist who actually sees me and sees how bad i am and i finally feel like i might be able to get better after a 10 year long struggle i can finally see a faint faint light of hope i genuinely hope you can get the same that you can find a therapist who can help you because these bouts of depression and your over analyzing shit is valid and deserve treatment\n",
            "you just described my life there is work me home me and a me i put on when friends are around the home me is the only real me but no one wants to be around that person so i do my best to put my mask on when others are around\n",
            "my classmates think i m a charming gay best friend to everyone lol not like that when i m alone\n",
            "well i m kinda the same tbh byt sometimes i wear a mask even at home and find excuses for salt moments or when i look broken\n",
            "i m 60 years old and you described my whole life since college i have no friends no kids no hobbies same job for 35 years just putting in time until i retire and then die don t be me get some help and keep trying until you find the answer and the veil falls away\n",
            "this is me i have shut down so far now that i can feel my depression wake up with me sit beside me as i put my shoes on it s like this mad love for each other my depression doesn t want to leave me i m comforting to her i long for the fake me to become realistic the perfect wife the happy mother the put together picture perfect family no one knows every time i shut the bathroom door i lose my mind and feel like my heart shatters into a million pieces counseling doesn t help medication doesn t help why can t i just be the fake me what s the real definition of happiness i don t think i ve ever experienced it\n",
            "everything is a lie people don t want to actually see you for who you are when you truthfully answer the question how is your day going it s all awkward bullshit every interaction is plainly superficial and there are no real human connects past what are you doing this weekend small talk or if you do think they are your friends wait until life gets hard for you then you will find out who actually gives a shit about your well being people use you in the here and now to fulfill their needs but they don t actually care about your needs then you think about dying because what is the point anyways but the fear of upsetting others outweighs that so called selfish desire it makes you feel like a hollow shell of a person i m sorry you are suffering you are not alone\n",
            "out of curiosity as i can relate to what you say how do you do regarding potential romantic partners do you have a close one\n",
            "i go to school make people happy and be a little happy i go home and die inside\n",
            "this is way to close to home for me because overall people deem me as generally a happy go lucky person before a series of sorrowful circumstances happened and i was diagnosed with mdd it s very hard to open up almost no one really believes how crippling my mdd is especially at night i live by myself they think you re just being negative or not in a mood but you re not some of them have even characterized me as oblivious but they don t know that i m giving so much effort to not having emotions cos a little will overwhelm me i m the same when you said you replay things in your head all day i feel utterly nothing to offer although i feel i genuinely enjoy my time with friends but as soon as i lock those doors behind me a dark blanket envelope me i honestly don t know what to do\n",
            "i totally get it and it actively feels painful throughout the day to laugh and smile and working really hard can be a good distraction but it s also that much more exhausting giving something your all when you re already so emotionally and mentally drained it hurts just as much to be out there working and being around people acting ok when inside you re either numb your heart is breaking or you just feel sad all day but you re hiding it i ve been on both ends stuck in bed and then wearing a mask and sometimes the mask was more painful at least at home i could just be numb or cry it out or sleep out in the world it actually felt like daggers in my heart all day trying to act fine i d be laughing on the outside and as corny as it sounds crying on the inside is go to the bathroom cry and then go back out and fake smile\n",
            "it s like an autobiography reading this walking depression is so real no one knows about it i ve been letting the mask slip lately though i am getting so tired\n",
            "this is me i m very high functioning and even outgoing it s something i pride myself in no matter how horrible i feel about myself who i am or what i ve done i make a point of getting up getting dressed and fighting it tooth and nail this in spite of extreme depression that makes me feel like a shell of a human being living in a worthless world filled with everyday humanoids i also have a lot of anxiety and suffer from ocd so that keeps me active it s constantly a fight between the two extremes\n",
            "this really hit home for me today i have a friend who might kind of fall into the first group we have similar symptoms but for her it s definitely debilitating and overwhelming and she s open to talking about it because it s essentially her whole life when she s in a serious depressive period but i feel completely the opposite i am bright i am awake and alive and cheerful i take care of everyone around me i have two jobs i m a full time student i m always working with meeting new people i have huge goals and projects i also lie to every single person i know i steal i drink every single night self harming and suicidal ideation i m paranoid there are little gaps in my memory i hear things that aren t there i can t cry i am scared of everyone abandoning me so i haven t made a new friends since middle school as i m a college student now i manipulate everyone i know because i need to be in control of the situation i don t talk to anyone about how i feel it s exactly like you said that s what s behind the veil i am literally living a double life and nobody knows which is why it s so hard to talk about when i m forced to they don t ever believe i could be hurting like this it s fucking horrible\n",
            "i get that read something recently though that said when you cringe at past things you ve done it s because you ve grown helps me a lot with anxiety also people don t care as much as you think they do that s both a sad and uplifting fact not everyone is analyzing your every move and it s okay to be sad in private it s quite common just make sure you talk to someone preferably a professional much love 3\n",
            "i feel you there that s exactly how i am i just got a promotion i have money everything is good in life but the better it gets the worse i feel\n",
            "at least u have a job i keep getting fired because i look miserable and employers hate that but mostly because i m just too damn slow and always need reassurance on what i m suppose to do\n",
            "same my parents know me as a loyal human being and most of my friends think i m weird and cooperative but the few real friends and gf that i have oh boy\n",
            "i ve started my graduation internship this week in half a year from now i ll have earned my master degree i feel like an imposter this post was very relatable and i m sorry things are so difficult for you\n",
            "same here i ve been doing ok at work but then get home and just lay in bed and don t eat or do anything productive weekends are the worst\n",
            "i know the feeling i m in an otherwise high functioning state but i m so lonely and numb with my depression\n",
            "i feel the same way i go about my normal life with no issue i have near perfect attendance at work i make most of my outside commitments and still find time to go and do things like have lunch out and visit those who are dying in the nursing home as soon as i m alone though it s like i m a totally different person and i just sink i can t stand it\n",
            "yess this has become my life it s always a bubbly mask if i don t wear it people dont like me\n",
            "i can relate to this in the sense that i try to appear happy and problem free in the presence of friends and family when that s the exact opposite of how i really feel it s draining putting on that mask every day i however lack the energy and motivation to be high functioning i m constantly late to events and putting myself into poor situations due to the anxiety i feel on a daily basis i know you re probably exhausted from pretending it really is difficult to keep up the act\n",
            "i felt exactly like you described before taking birth control and an antidepressant it change my life have you taken any medication\n",
            "thanks for writing this i can absolutely relate i have a big smile and love to laugh it up with the people i work with and i work hard and with care at the end of the day when i walk out the door i just feel my face drop because i m so tired of being there s been days i get home from work and just bawl for no reason a handful of days might be a manageable light feeling time but i ve learned to expect at least a couple of days where i wonder hard about why i m alive i manage to shower everyday and i pay my bills on time i have a spacious suite and a small companion as my friend i look presentable and clean but i do slip up which i m ashamed of i have troubles keeping up with laundry after i clean it so i just have a pile sometimes the insomnia gets me and i sleep in and arrive late to work moments at work find me trembling noticeably to others so far i have always found myself back together again though so far i m trying to remind myself to have hope and to be grateful for what i have even the work the hope helps in the darker moments we got this far and we deserve to be brave\n",
            "honestly it s scarier when i m not miserable in the dead of night because it s usually an indication that something has gone off kilter but i never know for sure so i ll try to push through until i inevitably short circuit and mess something up\n",
            "i feel this you re not alone i also get up everyday put on my game face but inside i m often screaming inside\n",
            "i really needed to hear this i ve been struggling with whether or not it s even right for me to post on here because i m not sure i actually have depression just because i m pretty high functioning on the outside thank you for sharing\n",
            "damn and i thought that only i have something like that i read on other comments that you often change your places of work i m college student so i don t have that possibility but from 6 months 1 year i always end up to be friends with completly other people than before people like me and i m always nice to everyone hardworking my family is really supportive of me and i have huge amount of luck in my life my apparence it s not like 10 10 but thanks to my character mask i get some attention from opposite gender who supposed to be out of my league but even though everyone likes me i personally hate myself and think of myself as someone weird and cringey never been in relationship even if i had chance with decent boys since i cringed that they liked me and ran away when i have obvious shot with someone i make myself think that it s all in my head and i could never make someone take interest in me never truely liked any of my friends even though they were amazing and felt guilty and sorry because of it got into dream college and felt numb when i expected to be happy i don t know what s wrong with me just trying my best every fucking day but every minute i feel as someone worse from anybody else and after achievieng my dream goal not feeling happy but rather guilty that i could make even better\n",
            "this was me before the depression became debilitating you might be overestimating how long you can keep this up i m not saying i know what it s like for every single person with depression but from myself and those around me it usually starts off how you describe living two separate lives but holding it together enough to survive and then without help or proper care it gets worse and worse to the point where you can t function then you re really fucked bc things start crumbling around you and you can only just sit helplessly and watch it all collapse on you so now not only have you become nonfunctioning but you have this incredibly overwhelming task of trying to pick up the pieces of your entire life and put them back together this is when most people admit they need professional help and it s better late than never but it is so fucking hard to take those steps when you re lower than you ve ever felt in your entire life my suggestion is getting professional help while you re able to stay above water if you haven t already if you are getting help you need to make it your absolute top priority preventive care sure beats the fuck out of diagnostic care edit a typo\n",
            "yup same here though my depression waxes and wanes it s still there waiting to manifest like a demigorgon to duck the joy out of me and inject darkness\n",
            "i understand exactly what you are say me personally i live my work life married life my so called smile for everyone life my daydreaming life n my reality i daydream so much i feel like my dreams are reality but as soon as i snap out of if i feel life is so hopeless i keep telling myself everything will be ok but even i know when i am lying to myself somedays in not as bad but others i just crawl in hole be left by myself n just let me be me n hopefully i ll snap out of it before it takes over completely\n",
            "imho that routine is very common for those who are still able to be productive if you haven t yet seen a psychiatrist now might be a good time the earlier you grab it by the horns the better it will be for your future wishing you well\n",

            "ugh me too it is so difficult i have such a good life with how i just graduated from my dream college and i m back home with my family and my fiancee and my life is finally taking off because i found a job j really like but even though i have all this positivity running through my life there is so much horrible sadness flowing through me my mother constantly tells me to take my medication if i m anxious i feel like it encourages addiction she also tells me that she doesn t understand why i get myself so worked up about things always putting the blame on me for events that she can control pertaining to her family i don t want to say my life is bad it s far from it it s just very hard when your mother constantly blames you for your mental illness\n",
            "same thing i look like the cheeriest happiest person at work even when i m with friends everything looks like its so well no one would recognize the dreadful me if they saw it they wouldn t believe how badly it exists\n",
            "this is me except this tuesday i suddenly can t control myself and cried in the middle of a lecture i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder around two months ago and when i told my friend everyone was like but you are happy all the time i can t stop crying at night when i am alone and i cry for few hours in the morning before i go to school but when i am at school i always behave like everything s fine and i am so happy two weeks ago i couldn t stop crying and having those suicidal thoughts and ended up in the hospital but the next day after they discharged me i acted like nothing happened this whole i am happy mask is making me feel even worse but the good thing is my medicines finally started to work and i am getting better now i think you need to see a psychiatrist as well those antidepressant drugs might have bad reputation but they actually work\n",
            "i ve had both i think i personally prefer high functioning cause when it gets to the other extent i can t pay my bills or i fail classes but the feelings suck no matter how it looks from the outside it s nice to have this sub because the people in my life don t understand at all i don t think it s something you can totally understand unless you go through it\n",
            "that s almost exactly how it was for me a few years ago until an opportunity came up for me to move to a different state i decided to use it as a fresh start to take back control of my life and just be myself even if it meant being transparently depressed and awkward in front of everyone i talked to it was uncomfortable and difficult at first but it got easier as time passed i am still depressed but i am also vastly more at peace with myself and i got to know myself better in the process\n",
            "i know this post has gotten a lot of comments now but i too relate and i have in the past smoked weed as a coping mechanism is there anyone here who has done the same i m keen to share experiences\n",
            "i feel ya i technically have high functioning depression but i wouldn t call myself functioning\n",
            "you just describe to a tee exactly what i experience every day at work i never really realized exactly what i was doing until i read this reading this kind of made me feel less alone in a messed up way so thank you for that it s comforting to know i m not struggling alone and not everyone else is perfect i ve never related with anything more in my life i go to work and people genuinely love me and think i m an amazing person i m able to make everyone laugh and smile but when no one is around i honestly hate myself i judge every little interaction i have with a customer or employee and belittle myself over something stupid i said or unnecessary i get home and literally cry about how much i hate my life and doing this every day ive been struggling to eat and sleep properly lately but i think it s just a domino effect of everything else triggering my depression i just want you to know that you aren t alone either there are more people like you struggling silently every day maybe we can all help eachother if we can find eachother lol\n",
            "i feel you sometimes there are days like today where i just lay in bed when i really should put my clothes away and also study for an exam but at least i m functioning enough to be in college it might be seriously hit or miss on how well i do but i m here and at least i have a job it s a shitty job but i m able to drag myself to my shifts some people can t do that so i guess i m functioning enough at least at this period in my life to make it easy for people to tell me to just push through gotta hussle in this dog eat dog world but i m really not good at the hussling i just kinda exist that s my story as someone who feels in between high functioning and can t get outta bed it s an odd place to be\n",
            "oh wow i was literally googling high functioning depression treatments yesterday i m glad i ve found this thread because i ve never seen what i feel like written down so accurately the last couple of months in particular though it s lasted for much longer than i ve been desperate to get home from work or any social activities i enjoy where i socialise am outgoing laugh chat etc so i can make dinner and get high and watch tv play video games alone because being sober and doing those things isn t enough anymore i need to be high to take the edge off and truly keep me distracted i go to the gym dance work i have multiple friend groups and i try to keep busy but there s always that pull inside me telling me i need to get away i fixate on things that are wrong with me constantly like physically and mentally and my personality when i m out and about i feel confident chatty and smiley but when i get home and i don t feel like i m adequately distracted and i feel so frustrated i could scream and instead i just cry and cry and want to pull my own hair out sometimes when i m alone i have a flatmate who i don t see much but her presence in the flat makes me really uncomfortable because i just want to be alone i feel like i m not alone enough like just knowing i m in the same building as other people makes me want to go and drive away into the middle of nowhere and just stay there or move somewhere else completely and start fresh even people i like messaging me can be too much because i feel like life is already overwhelming without friends wanting to talk to me when i m finally alone but i ll still see them and eventually get back to them i go to a counsellor every three weeks to just talk through things that are going on and she does always make me feel a bit better but she s also constantly asking if maybe i m a bit lonely and telling me that my goal should be to get in touch with my true self and then everything will fall into place but i have no idea who my true self is like if i ve managed to live to my late twenties and not understand who i am how am i supposed to start now and i don t feel lonely because i genuinely want to be alone i just don t know what to do with myself when i am alone unless i m high or really into tv or a game is this high functioning depression or some sort of weed addiction or both or something completely different i m getting to the point where i m considering going back on citalopram because at least then i felt like i didn t care about anything also sorry for the ramble i ve not talked about this properly really so i m sort of letting it all out haha\n",
            "i ve never related to anything more in my life not to mention my sisters the complete opposite which i feel makes my high functioning depression worse she will have full melt downs which lead her to psychiatric hospitals therefore all eyes go on her no one even sees me struggling and i feel guilt expressing because of her i also go to work everyday and school and will look fine but go home and just sob because i feel so alone and misunderstood and uncared for me being so high functioning has led everyone to have such high expectations of me while my older sister is expected of much less and has much more support\n",

            "i understand what you re saying and i m glad you brought attention i ve always saw it as conforming to an environment the people around you can affect your mood and for some it s so extreme where you seem like a different person i personally think i might have problems with this in school i do fine laugh and talk with friends i get good grades and do all my work out in public is an iffy sometimes i ll feel as if i can t show any emotion at all and other times i ll feel like an entirely different person with a different personality anywhere at home or when i m by myself or with family members i act almost like a zombie i feel as if i can t feel anything at all and others are just going to be judging me for anything i do this could go hand and hand with bipolar disorder but more predictable instead of changing personalities it s mood that changes depending on your location and people you re with i ll definitely do more research on this and maybe we can all learns something\n",
            "hey i m exactly like you i have a normal 9 to 5 job a flat good friends and everything but every time i get back home i feel empty and worthless and cry myself to sleep i think it has something to do with the modern society we re living in where everything we pursue money career material possesion are viewed as the thing that will make you happy with all the stress that goes along with it we re fucking animals no better than a cow or a chicken what we really need to feel happy is food shelter and be surrounded by people who love us for what we are and whom we love back in that point of view all we do in our everyday life is fucking meaningless i think you should take a risk dive deep into yourself and find the thing that you really want to share with the world and even if other people tell you it s impossible to achieve or that you ll end up broke do it yes you could in fact fail loose everything you own but who cares you re not happy anyway you only got one shot my friend and times goes by so fast i myself have a dream i want to make music since at least ten years but i never had the guts to really try to make it next month i quit my job and apply for welfare i ll be broke and it ll be rough but at least i will do something that seems valuable to me i m tired of seeing the same dark clouds over my head i wanna see the colors feel alive escape from all this stress and fake people surrounding me the time is now\n",

            "this is totally me i kept wondering how do i differentiate depression from self pitying and how can my depression be justified if i don t have problem getting my work done or eating or sleeping etc thanks for sharing this so i know i m not alone\n",
            "same here and when i do decide to discuss what s on my mind i usually end up feeling stupid because it s not logical i m an analytical thinker so it just makes things worse when it comes to wanting to discuss my emotions often times i ll wanna discuss them but it seems stupid so i don t for example the emotion i m angry at life something out of my control my brain s tirade at me you re fucking stupid that s the most illogical statement i ve heard you say on the planet not to mention a cliche one as well don t say anything else that is stupid it s in the past and thats the end of the argument the definition of the past is something that is behind you and not ahead of you it s fucking useless to debate the facts or emotions if it s already in the past\n",
            "i m trying to find the will to live lately i m not stimulated by anything i m recognizing the patterns i saw before and it s boring to keep on living the same thing over and over i am unable to find the purpose of myself and of life in general the faces of my friends and family are the only reason way am i holding on other than them i m standing on a thin ice layer here\n",
            "i do things a lot like you i feal like someone else when im with people at least its not as bad as your sitiuation i hope you get better sorry for spelling mistakes\n",
            "my job forces me to be an extrovert everyone sees me as a happy go lucky guy but although everything is going great i find myself googling why am i sad i once read a passage that said we all wear three masks one is what we show our peers one is what we show family and friends and one is what we never show anyone but our selves i feel like i m constantly showing the first two and i don t know who i am anymore when the third claws at me comes out relationships are hard because i don t know who would accept the mess i ve become i don t need their disapproval and disappointment and it s a vicious cycle of friends and loved ones\n",
            "i feel as though i am in the same place as you i do well at work i get good grades i do what i need to do because i seem fine my support system tends to take my mental health for granted i ve stopped reaching out for support because when i do i don t get any today was a hard day so i built up the courage to reach out to three people and they all ignored me i feel like i m living inside of myself separate from everyone else it s a terribly lonely way to live\n",
            "i know how you feel today has been kinda of a bad day as far as my depression i don t know why i feel sad over no reason it s very draining to put on your happy mask when all i want to do is stare at the wind and let go close my eyes and just be me i ll be myself when i get the chance to have alone time you know i don t want my spouse thinking i m not stable or so honestly there is no reason for me to really feel like this but i do i have been curse with this disease it s a weird feeling you just feel like you don t belong anywhere and i m so tired of it i feel so sad right now so i know what you mean about living a double life it really feels that way\n",
            "i did that for years every day it was work try to laugh at anything i could then go home alone and sleep now i m a low functioning depressive schizophrenic who is afraid of the cold\n",

            "thank you for sharing i definitely feel the same i also feel like i constantly need to be distracted so i m not left alone with my thoughts\n",
            "you ve described this perfectly it s so difficult to navigate when you re carrying different sides of yourself through the day\n",
            "i ve been living like this for a few years recently something happen and i lost someone i care about i tried to fix things to get out of this depression because i feel like part of this was a reason i lost her after a month i ve lost all motivation and now i feel like i m about the enter that dark place that started all this i wish i never came out of that dark place years ago all the responsibilities that i used to carry out with a fake mask and smile is all piling up i am so close to giving up i can t sleep well anymore and when i do i just sleep more than i should sometimes with nightmares and sometimes just because i don t want to deal with life i am really close to just letting go i wish i could just sleep and disappear out of existence\n",
            "wow i swear you took the words out of my mouth just yesterday i went to work and was my normal chipper self and laughed and cut up with my co workers and got stuff done but when i got home all i could do was sit alone in my pitch black living room listening to sad music it s so emotionally exhausting to have to put on this front every day\n",
            "over analyzing yourself being super critical worrying about everything you say replaying every conversation that ever happened and wondering how or why you said that and how everyone is judging you and you are worthless and want to die she really struggled commuting home from work and thought many a time about driving off a bridge or an embankment the sadness was like a black wall she couldn t move past\n",
            "happy thoughts i don t know what those are sorry like i ve always been rather emotionally stunted or dulled but lately it s so much more a fog over the happy sounds terrible bc you know what you are missing do you ever peek out from under the fog\n",
            "this is me all the time for at least 8 years with varying levels but always the same started seeing a counselor and it s amazing how far back that i ve felt this way\n",
            "this one brought tears to my eyes i hope you the best in trying to move onwards and up\n",
            "i can relate very much to you of course no one can know how exactly you get through it i m just happy i found this post what you are doing is very difficult and i understand how not feeling proud of our own accomplishments is but i just want to tell you that you living through this the way you are is something to be proud of hope you heal from this\n",
            "i get what you re talking about using your job to distract yourself but the second things slow down you re swallowed with the dead nothing inside you it does great for career growth but the moment you re not super busy you re depressed and miserable yeah i get it i don t know how to stop it\n",
            "i feel like i could have written this myself i dont have anything helpful to add i m afraid only to confirm you re not the only person who feels this way\n",
            "i know thisll get lost in the sea of comments but i feel exactly the same honestly i credit this to a few things but above all i prioritize being positive above all else being positive is my default coping mechanism i dont know how to change this and im not sure if i want to but it is what it is i feel as if everything i do is a facade i put up and at this point i dont even know if its me or whoever im trying to be anymore\n",
            "i am high functioning have lots of friends good job healthy people look at me like an assertive confident older brother leader come to be for advice and help yet inside i don t know if that is me or if it s all fake i feel like i could easily give up and die just to cease this constant depression but i don t i keep chasing happiness and fuck it up when i find it as my insecurities come out n ruin things there s two of me in my head and the depressed one has been ever present over the past month i fear for the future\n",
            "so did you secretly audio record me before typing this this is exactly what i love everyday i appear great from the outside but have all kinds of issues\n",
            "this was me until one day the depression blocked me from going into work it was like a force field around my office and i just couldn t go in it was the same way i feel when i turn on the shower and stare at the running warm water and for some reason i just can t lift my legs to walk in god i wish i were sad or loathed myself but it was just a moment of realizing i couldn t keep living this double life i turned around walked to my car sent my resignation email and have been driving uber ever since\n",
            "this is not talked about enough thanks for bringing this up it s hard being a jack of all trades being nearly good at everything i try seems counterintuitive but being good at sp much it s hard to say who i really am i don t have an identity and to be on this side of high functioning depression vs being low functioning depression years back is confusing\n",
            "wow i just came here to post something very similar i ve gotten recent comments on how well i m doing and it s frightening that i can fool those closest to me my depression is getting worse and yet i m getting even better at covering it up\n",
            "hard relate but i m lucky enough to go a pretty good while between episodes sometimes sometimes it s even long enough to feel like maybe i made it all up then something triggers it and it s all back and very real suicide ideations and all i m blessed with a great wife and job and everything so it really just leaves my own brain and inner issues to blame\n",
            "i found your post while trying to explain myself to my wife it s absolutely me i appreciate you sharing it helps\n",
            "i got fired 5 months ago it threw my coworkers off because they adored me i was so friendly and so helpful and i gave off an energy that i was trying my hardest all the time i was trying my hardest and i really mean that being productive was absolutely exhausting for me in our career field i had a hard time keeping up but i didn t tell anyone about it so by the time i got fired my boss and supervisor said that they were genuinely upset about letting me go because i was exactly the kind of person they wanted working for them they had tried everything they could to get me caught up and i just couldn t do it i didn t fight it because i knew i wasn t good enough i just cried and said thank you for the opportunity\n",
            "wow you took the words straight out of my mouth i can t take it anymore i m sad all the time\n",
            "yea i ve thought if that i d be happy as long as i was warm enough comfy enough in as minimalistic a way as possible food used to be important as a life requirement but not so much anymore i contemplate do i want to be alone almost hermit like but then i think i couldn t handle the solitude and would yearn for those deep conversations that i used to have when friends were part of my life sorry for the rambling i m rather despondent at present and am trying hard to repress memories of the past as futile and effort as that is loneliness i suppose i don t know\n",
            "this is how i feel as well i m not sure why but maybe the fact of having a higher income profession or being in the public eye puts additional pressure to keep everything under wraps\n",
            "to be honest i skimmed what you wrote because everything you wrote sounds just like my daily life i wish that i would get worse so people notice or get better so it all stops anyway you re getting a lot of great responses and i m happy for you just wanted to say you re not alone and thank you for sharing\n",
            "you sound just like me i m diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and it s highly likely you could be experiencing the same thing\n",
            "i feel this exact same way i m glad i m not alone in this i too have a good career and am well liked at my job but on my days off i barely make it out of bed due to my crippling depression it has seem to have gotten worse the last few weeks i don t have many friends or socialization outside of work i was working out at one point and that did make me feel better but lately i haven t even had the energy for that i sure hope that it will get better for you and i both thank you for making me not feel so alone in this\n",
            "bro i feel this so hard i feel the crippling depression part mine come from my low self esteem and hating myself not as a person just my appearance sometimes i look in a mirror i just breakdown and loose it thinking is this really life and wonder how much longer i can go like this i have to beat my depression or i honestly don t know how long i can go shit sucks i just wanna be happy and get a gf normal 17 year old shit and i m caught up wanting to kms because i think i m hideous im basically my own bully if i think of it putting on a happy face everywhere i go but when i go home i m miserable\n",
            "i sort of know how you feel the more i live this life the more i feel like i m deceiving everyone and myself on the outside i look happy to people of course i have days where i can t hide my unhappy expression and when people ask me i just say that i m tired and had an exhausting night of work but in reality it s just sadness taking over me i can t confide in parents because they obviously don t understand trust me i ve tried and i don t want to burden them i tried confiding in friends non directly because again i didn t want to bring up problems like these to people i care about i ve tried in the past to actually let them know but again the double life role kicked in where i pretended that it was all over and i was happy again it s tough man after a few months of isolating myself i started to change i was an extrovert or at least that s what people would say but now deep down i feel like i ve changed of course i can still talk to people and be friendly with them but i can t be my true self in that sense i still have my outgoing personality but this is all becoming a cover and these days it s all just kicking in i ve lost my friends that i thought i was close with i shut myself out from them but it hurts that they weren t able to see anything that i was going through yes i understand that that s not fair for them but i feel like if we were close friends they would be able to tell somethings different you know sorry this is all over the place huh didn t mean to take over and start my story it just kind of came out and i found myself typing this all out but anyways i just wanted to say that i completely understand what you mean about living a double life i would say you re not alone but i feel like that might not be any sort of advice on consolation that also may not be the best comment just know that there is someone who understands what you mean and what you re going through\n",
            "this is just me thank you for putting into words what i didn t know how to describe\n",
            "this post and several of the comments describe situations that sound very familiar to me have any of you guys had long term romantic relationships i d be really interested in comparing notes thanks\n",
            "wow i could ve written this as if they were my exact thoughts i was let go from my job basically for not being good enough small office and i tried so hard to fit in i never did and be helpful i am applying for jobs but the thought of doing this again just kills me inside and my mind is racing telling me i m a failure but i try because i don t want to let my family down my husband doesn t understand my depression and anxieties so i just keep it to myself hoping i ll change one day i am untreated due to negative past experiences and my mom has a range of mental health issues that i m sure i ve inherited and feel like a shit mother for feeling this way and bringing 2 kids into this world i feel hopeless and am ashamed to say suicide and heavily drinking have crossed my mind i m pregnant and have a 10 month old what s fucking wrong with me\n",

            "i feel like this is me but it s gotten significantly worse over the last year or so i think it s been brought on by the fact that i found out that my dad has als and parkinsons and my parents didnt tell me for years i found out and couldnt tell anyone so that kinda screwed me up trying to process it all mostly on my own i have a therapist for different reasons but i dont feel like i can talk to her or anyone i used to be top of my class but now i m failing everything i m homeschooled and i have to essentially teach myself because i don t do online school its all textbooks and paper i can t get anything done and my parents lecture me for being lazy i can t concentrate i feel like i m gonna explode if i have to read one more page of science i used to be in to music a lot i play four instruments and i would play literally for hours and sing a lot now i barely practice at all i feel so frustrated and stuck my mom now knows that i know about my dad but he doesn t know that i know so i can t even defend myself when they call me lazy and my keeps telling me that i cant keep using my dads issues as an excuse for not keeping up with school but honestly i just want to jump off a freaking bridge im miserable and i hate myself i constantly question my existence and wonder what would happen if i crashed the car into a pole or if i pointed a gun at my head and pulled the trigger but then i hang out with friends and everything is fine and i can have fun with them and it s so confusing am i depressed wtf is wrong with me\n",

            "the amazing thing about a post like yours is it opens the door for others to tell their stories the stigmatization of our illness has shamed us into feeling like we have to wear the mask i also wear a mask and most people i am around would never know the other side i joined a dbsa support group in my area and it s probably the best thing i ever did in regards to coming to terms with who i am and what i m going through like this post there is a collection of people who actually understand and in some small way that helps it doesn t make it all better or make it any less crushing but it somehow creates the feeling of being somewhat less hopeless how amazing would it be if this post turned into some kind of support group where we could all help each other through our dark days i would join in a heartbeat\n",

            "i have been told the same thing my entire life as well they don t understand that your feelings are yours you feel things regardless of how good or bad you have it that still matter and should always be taken seriously people like that tend to not be able to empathize you haven t done nothing wrong\n",

            "i m sorry that happened to you maybe they were trying to make you feel better some people don t handle emotional situations very well of course anyone can have it worse than anyone else but it s not a contest and sometimes we just need someone to look us in the eye and say i m sorry you are going through this that sucks or i hear ya it may help to write down what is bothering you and what responses you would have liked to hear you could act out a conversation where you state what s upsetting you and then pretend you are an objective listener and say the words you were hoping others would say to you\n",
            "hey love it will all be ok families suck a lot of the time people who don t understand depression can t really sympathize im going to make a server for us feel free to join\n",
            "that sucks i m sorry that happened i feel like that s one of the worst responses imo i get they may mean well but it s so invalidating dismissive\n",
            "this is very reason why i don t open up to my family many of them are dismissive of what i go through but i ve come to the conclusion that it s not a bad reflection on me it s actually a testament to their poor character\n",

            "family does that i noticed that humans feel the same emotions no matter their situation given the time you ll feel like shit if your so leaves you whether you re rich or poor sexy or ugly varying degrees but shit will always feel like shit dont let them invalidate your feelings they had it worse yeah not worse than jews in the holocaust children starving in africa oh that s different so is what they ve been through compared to you had a roommate do this all the time i moved out he got depressed because i was the best roommate hes ever had i dont fucking care fuck him for standing on a podium judging the weight of my feelings i feel what i fucking feel and fuck anyone who says otherwise i m just as prepared to throw you to the side with him\n",
            "that is the worst thing to do they are your family and they are supposed to love and support you unconditionally i m really sorry this is happening it happened to me the first time i tried to tell my mum i was depressed buy a helmet life just gets harder as you grow up i hope you have friends by your side and you can find the strength to get the help you need sending love\n",
            "i recently attempted suicide been depressed about 7 years i m just about to turn 18 and my family who i saw daily for that entire time didnt know anything was wrong until they got the call that i was in hospital so i cant personally relate to this but i do understand and trust me when i say that the next step isnt to hide away and never let this happen again you need to find help talk to a therapist start a journal express yourself some way dont bottle it up and then break for a week every few months like i did hiding away to cry pushing everyone away so they cant see you what your family did was wrong they and you shouldnt compare you to others in that way i m reminded of a podcast episode i listened to recently on purpose with jay shetty 7 ways to stop comparing yourself to others i think it might help you that series was recommended to me while i was in hostpital i think it might help you too\n",
            "sorry about that a lot of us know what it s like just remember that your problems are valid too and you shouldn t need to feel ashamed that you have them\n",
            "ok so those people that have it worse how do we know they take it the same way we do why are we able to even judge on how something may be worse yeah sure something worse is out there but for that s the worse what s happening to you rn is the worst for you and that s all that matters i actually have having a breakdown last night and was talking to my boyfriend during it and he actually said other people have it worse and when i said what i just said to you he said that made complete sense and i think i got it through to him that i don t want to hear what when i m coming to him with my problems\n",
            "thats the worst ever dont worry everyone in this sub and outside this sub are here for you if you ever need to talk including me\n",
            "i ve been told that by my parents before don t let them get to your head no one is supposed to get treated first or last depression isn t a contest what matters is making sure we can help as many people as possible your family still loves you very much and are trying to help in the only ways they know how tell them what they said made you feel hurt and you could discuss some ways of making you feel better\n",
            "doesn t that just validate your situation more my life is far from a mess etc and i still don t enjoy it i d hate to think where i d be at if my life was any worse but at the same time i just don t see how it can even get better at this point it kinda is what helped me realise i was depressed being in a good situation in life but feeling no joy from everything i do have\n",
            "i have had this said to me before like i understand that there are people who are dealing with bigger issues but it doesn t mean my problems don t matter everyone is dealing with something and it still hurts no matter how big or small the issue may be\n",
            "bs don t let that grey to you although i know how hard it is my family it s the same way\n",
            "the crappy part is when you learn how lots of people out there tend to do that and you have to find a way to accept that that is the way people will just be about those who have depression\n",
            "that s a pretty normal though ignorant reaction people don t know how to handle it being in the open hopefully you can find someone who is a better listener and able to lend some of their own peace good luck\n",
            "i m sorry to hear that dude i know how that feels and its honestly the reason why i almost never talk about how i m feeling to any of my friends or family it sucks but i feel like the whole one up manship s when it comes to depression things that get people down in their individual lives isn t healthy it only makes people even more depressed and not want to talk about it for fear of being told your problems arent as bad as mine someone elses just know that whatever you re going through its okay to feel the way you re feeling you re the one who has to live with it not the rest of your family if it gets any worse i would look into maybe seeking professional help if that s at all possible for you good luck\n",
            "that s messed up the last thing you need to hear when your depressed is tht other ppl have it worse and saying there problems are more important than your own\n",
            "telling you that you can t be sad since others have it worse is like telling somone you can t be happy since others have it better you re allowed to have those feelings i m sorry that your efforts to express them were met with such backlash\n",
            "this is relatable on a ton of levels i told my family i had depression and anxiety and they went on a rampage about how people in the philippines have it way worse and that i should be thankful\n",
            "it doesn t matter pain is pain they shouldn t be comparing your pain to others because you re obviously hurting stay strong friend\n",
            "its unfortunate that your family could not listen to you openly and with empathy they may or may not have their own issues that no one has ever truly heard and so they aren t capable of extending that to you and that sucks but like others have said before estrangement from family is sometimes necessary is there someone else you can speak to about this if not well even if so i would like to hear what you told your family and i will listen quotes because were typing on the internet as best as possible\n",
            "i hate this so much just because your problems aren t as bad as others doesn t mean that your problems aren t bad it s like saying why are you so happy other people has much better reasons to be happy sorry you have deal with that\n",
            "i feel like a lot of time when i bring up my issues they just get 1upped by someone who doesn t understand that i m opening up to them pushing me to not open up as much\n",
            "god i m so sorry for this man your problems are real and valid no matter what anybody else is going through\n",
            "i don t know seems like a common response even with depressed people to compare their reasons with others not really negative just an attempt to communicate but really yet to see any response from someone that depression could not make into a negative\n",
            "i can completely relate to that and it s always awful i m so sorry they did that to you you shouldn t have to deal with that\n",
            "this is why i try not to cry in front of my family because i ve heard the same story over and over again\n",
            "worst thing to say to anyone in life that s why i walked away from so many people and only kept the ones who never compared or anything if you go to therapy maybe you can take one of them with you so they know it s real i did that once and it worked like magic much love\n",
            "it doesn t matter if other people have it worse when you are in a dark place in your mind there is no other worse place you are as low as it gets your family may have had good intentions trying to put perspective on your situation but that is not helpful what you need is a hand to hold a shoulder to cry on a big hug and someone to just listen i m so sorry your family reacted to you this way you are not alone\n",
            "i think it s because so many people are just purely competitive and in modern society people are conditioned into status obsession and a lot of people lose those human qualities of genuine empathy for other people s problems and also just being nice remember we live in a money obsessed society it isn t a science and philosophy obsessed society and it s not yet a mental health awareness based society either it s still winner vs loser the haves and the have nots society to many people this is why you can talk to people and they are just egocentric all the time instead of a nice and easy humane acknowledgement and the other person relating to their own issues and empathising with you they would rather compare your huge problem to their problem being more important straight away and how others have it much worse rather then addressing what you have just mentioned as an explanation point sometimes you are better off talking to others whom you know are more likely to empathise often big egos and narcissistic types of people competitive sorts will just make the interaction worse or might even turn it into an argument or a battle you can open up about something very urgent and the next second the other person has turned it into a battle it s a picture of where society is currently at and a byproduct of people in modern culture\n",
            "of course people have it worse but that doesn t invalidate you and what you re going through i hated that growing up and i refuse to do that do my children it s important to let people know that they are not alone but it s equally important not to invalidate either\n",
            "that s no way to confront your problems experiences are relative and what you re going through might be harder than they thing given your circumstances and factors in your life of course other people might have it harder but they could also be more prepared in ways we aren t or it affects them differently and so on\n",
            "woah shitty response from your family i hate it whenever people minimize your pain that way pain isn t a contest minimizing or invalidating your pain doesn t make it go away or make it any easier the opposite compassion is the way to go and you may need a therapist to help you with self compassion with that kind of family dynamic check out kristin neff on self compassion on youtube here s a few self compassion is something i had to work on and her videos definitely helped me it s like self care homework\n",
            "that s fucking generational trauma for ya their ignorance is their bliss you are being so brave right now op confronting the root of your pain with such openness in time your family may come to recognise this but in the meanwhile pay them no heed just focus on you and your journey to better you can do it op\n",
            "hi i ll be your internet family you can vent to me your issues and send me lots of crying emojis i m not the best at comforting or advice but i will sympathize with you and send you memes and animal pictures\n",
            "i ve honestly started shutting out my family because of this reason it s either them comparing their problems to mine or how or why am i acting like that stay strong i ve definitely come to realize that family can really fucking suck ass\n",
            "when you re happy do people say you can t be happy because other people have it better\n",
            "my parents do the same thing i hate it sometimes i think it s my fault that i m an agitated person around them and get mad or sad but idk i understand and it sucks really\n",
            "someone is always gonna have it worse there s no point in playing the sad olympics\n",
            "they aren t wrong but so many other people have it better than you so why should you focus on those that don t have it as well everyone has feelings it doesn t always need to be relative\n",
            "oh god i hate those kinds of fucking people i just want you to know that even though it could possibly be worse i still understand that your problems are real and i would love to give you emotional support\n",
            "they ended up comparing their issues to mine and tell me that other people have it worse this happens all the time\n",
            "i hate when people tell me people have it worse or their problems are worse then mine\n",
            "i get that a lot with my family i ve more or less given up trying to convince them\n",
            "yep that s why you re depressed and unable to cope you re surrounded by wankers that not only can t see you but they also can t see their arrogance ignorance and arrogance is poison for us struggling souls rule of thumb don t try to get help from the wankers that created it unless you want to feel worse it is a sad reality a lot of us here face too that s why we are here for you\n",
            "i really know how you feel i would talk to my teacher about my depression last year and she was all like oh my life was so hard i still go to therapy so shut up and i m just like i m sure it was but i m talking about you\n",
            "i hate that other people have it worse bullshit they probably heard it when they were kids but if they remembered how much it didn t help them why do they still do it\n",
            "other people can have issues that doesn t mean ur issues dont matter and anybody who tells you this is a toxic bully\n",
            "everything you feel is valid it s not a competition of who has it worse i m sorry that reacted like that\n",
            "that is the worst thing ever and everytime makes me feel worse and super defeated they just don t understand but i m really sorry\n",
            "remember this just because someone else broke both of their arms doesn t make your arm any less broken you are entitled to have issues and feelings\n",
            "yep typical assholes sigh sorry bro but hey you got us on reddit to understand many of us are open to chat too\n",
            "i hate that i would try to see where this stems from and comfort you or anyone in that situation\n",
            "wow lets make you feel even worse now that you just tell me that you feel bad\n",
            "you might want to look at different universities programs that will take you away from your family maybe take a gap year and look for an internship or a paid job or take a job away from home over the holidays you can do it\n",
            "this has happened to me before my dad really didn t understand what i was going through i ended up reaching out to the suicide hotline for my area and that turned into a whole big thing too even after the fact my dad still tried to make it about him when we saw my therapist as a family parents suck sometimes and really just don t get it and for whatever reason won t just listen it s the worst feeling in the world to have your pain compared to other people s pain the truth is your pain could be and probably is as bad as theirs just because you have something they don t doesn t mean your life is automatically going to be better or mean that you will be happy i understand what you re going through and definitely do not think it is any less valid than anyone else s hardships you will get through this chapter in your life and be able to help others in the future i believe in you best of luck\n",
            "yeah people just generally have no idea how to comfort others with mental health issues theres this idea that you can make things better by bringing up the fact that others have it worse and that you have a lot to be grateful for but as you ve felt it can have the opposite effect when you feel like the world is too shitty to live in hearing about how others have it so much worse and how you shouldn t be complaining doesn t help a single bit\n",
            "yeah this has happened with me many times i ve also been told to not cry because i m a guy specifically to stop crying like a girl the only time i cry is every day multiple times and by myself i can t afford to not look like a man infront of others\n",
            "fuck that shit if they have the nerve to say that to you they dont have the slightest clue what youre really feeling i know how hard it is to be in that type of environment and i just hope that they start to make the effort to understand and support you until then youll always have a place here and for what its worth i believe in you we all do\n",
            "i honestly hate minimizing of ppl s depression let ppl share i m sorry you went through this\n",
            "u cannot help anyone with this argumentation i mean there will always be someone whos got it worse than u but everyone has his own problems and emotionally state\n",
            "i m sorry to hear that some families just don t know how to speak to a depressed person\n",
            "what about boating crew on a yacht pay is great get to travel and see the world i ve had friends who work on crews lines and love it if your on britan you have the nhs where you will get free counseling and possibly medication i recommend talking to someone it helped me out a lot and dont keep physical journals where someone in your house can read it i would do an app or open a separate e ail and keep journal on google docs so that way no o e can have access to it\n",
            "i hate the you can t be sad because other people have it worse bs what if someone said you can t be happy because others have it better than you oh right no one would op i hope that you have the help and support you need and that you know that your feelings are valid and that they aren t something to be ashamed of\n",
            "they always do that don t they i hate my job with a burning passion and being at it nearly every day doesn t help my depression my wife s father told me everyone deals with it i mean he wasn t being a dick in that moment but it s still so dismissive to hear i m sorry you had to deal with that\n",
            "sorry if i sound childish and selfish but i got so angry after reading this i totally relate to the op that s why i try my best to keep it together in front of them\n",
            "hope more and more people reading this thread so more people will know that telling worse stories of another person wont help a bit really annoyed by those people sorry to hear that op\n",
            "a teacher said the same and said it may be a part of puberty because my son stopped being sad after puberty yeah that really helps\n",

            "doesn t matter if other people have a worse situation your pain and suffering still matter i delt with the same shit from narsassistic family for 14 years it ended up with me attempting suicide multiple times i m better now though and taking medication along with counseling to deal with trauma i know exactly how this feels i live with my fiance and our beautiful baby now but back then as a kid were darker times i m so glad i m an adult now\n",
            "fuck them try to ignore their ignorance it s true there are people that have it worse but that never invalidates your own issues i wish you the best op stay strong in moments like these it is important that you push through it no matter how hard it is you ll come out a stronger person\n",
            "one of my mom s classic lines you have it so good what do you have to be depressed about i m sorry that your family isn t supportive it probably won t help much but know that there are random internet strangers here to listen you re not alone and hopefully eventually you can find a chosen family that does support you in all the ways that your blood or adopted family doesn t\n",
            "i don t understand why people are suggesting moving away from the family is your family abusive how old are you people don t know how to react to this stuff and so they say the dumbest sh like how they feel the same way but they don t give in how you shouldn t either bla bla i tell them they don t know what they re talking about and then they call me condescending i don t care though i feel lucky for being independent to a degree where i don t have to see or talk to anybody however my life is also pretty lonely and sometimes i wish i didn t screw up all my relationships in the past being alone is not a good idea for people with depression i think but being around people who aren t good for you isn t a good idea either\n",
            "this is just my 0 02 as far as experience goes i have been manic depressive bipolar bpd and ptsd and crippling anxiety i also used to be a parent if that matters i won t say i understand but i will say i can relate parents reason justify and attempt to make sense of things best they can while they are attempting to console and or teach regardless of how much they know about the subject try to remember there are no good books on how to be a parent they are trying i promise every parent is trying some more than others but you get the idea if i could offer anything i would say use your friends online people like us tend to not have a lot of close personal friends as much as we have our friends online hell i m almost 50 and i only have two friends that don t live in the internet anyways we tend to be far less judgemental aside from the ever present trolls and they just don t matter empathetic and we understand the criticality of just listening and letting someone talk through their feelings without someone else trying to help you are not alone you don t know me and i don t know you but if i can help i will be happy to do so parents will love you forever but they are not the best at listening to their children oh and try not to be preoccupied about crying in front of them there is nothing to be ashamed of anyone who tells you otherwise is seeking something red\n",
            "i m so sorry you had to go through that i hate it when people do that the whole point isn t to compare problems it s to just express your suffering and just have a moment to decompress preferably with people who can understand and provide a little comfort we ve all got problems terrible crap going on in our lives but no one is better or worse off than anyone else there s just no point in comparing pain it s like what s the point of trying to describe how they re worse off than you are you re in pain they re in pain why can t everyone just hug and take some time to just accept the comforting embrace of family\n",
            "it s like if i have a broken leg saying that it could be worse because some people don t have a leg at all is not helping me get my broken leg repaired add to the fact that left untreated my leg could end up being amputated you have legitimate problems and you need help i don t know what your situation is but please seek out actual help it sucks that you can t get it from your family but we can try to find you the help you need\n",
            "i m very sorry to hear i tell myself that too that i have to learn to appreciate the things and people i have in my life and stop whining because there are children dying from starvation cancer etc but the truth is we cannot compare suffering or success for that matter we cannot gather every sad person in this world and vote to see who s the most misfortunate one and only they re allowed to be depressed that s just not how it works don t listen to your family listen to yourself you re important your problems and suffering are real and deserve to be cared for\n",
            "my dad says he doesnt believe in depression i ve tried to talk to him multiple times and he tells me to just get over it and do something depression is just a bunch of whiny asses who are too lazy to get up and do something to stop being sad if you re depressed make yourself not depressed it s stupid man i cant wait to leave this household\n",
            "i understand your point went through the same shit but now at age 27 i ve realized that s all they know come from different times sucks they dont educate themselves but it is what it is they love you i m sure my dad listens and gives me advice comparing his mental health being unstable for a long time but just words it weird i see now thats his way of trying to comfort me lol\n",
            "let me tell you something telling people that others have bigger problem e t c is bad and idiotic and you know that right cause those people who has bigger problem form you have people who has bigger problem than them this is a never ending circle\n",
            "i ve been there my dad became a father at 15 served in the army has been homeless worked three jobs etc he loves to remind me how i shouldn t have depression and anxiety because i have it good and that he doesn t have either of those little does he understand that his high strung personality and quick to resort to anger attitude are most likely mental illnesses to here s a hug u zrudd97 3\n",
            "when i thought a friend of mine was close to killing himself i mentioned it to my mom not the best thing to do she told me that the only thing a kid should be worried about is his grades bruh i don t think anyone can control what he is worried or sad about\n",
            "that is the dumbest and most immature reaction you can give to someone who is feeling down\n",
            "i hate when people do that my parents did that at first and even some friends but it just took time for them to see that it s not the best thing to do i did have to educate them on what is good and what is not but i know it seems hopeless but don t worry there are plenty of people who will treat you well and with respect you are amazing you got this\n",
            "i ignore anyone who says other people have it worse or think how lucky you are these are phrases petty people use to make you feel bad about wanting a better life for yourself they want you to be content where you are so they don t have to hear you complain fuck them your problems are real they matter and deserve to be changed if you want to change them don t let anybody tell you you don t deserve happiness because you do\n",
            "and this is why i just keep it to myself suffering alone is better than the comparison game\n",

            "they don t understand but don t let that discourage you or make you feel worse my favourite quote to deal with that is saying someone can t be sad because someone else may have it worse is just like saying someone can t be happy because someone else might have it better\n",
            "that sucks my family has done the same in the past also saying that they went through similar things as me i get it though it could technically be worse but knowing that typically doesnt help you just want it to be better\n",
            "i hate when people do this family friends boyfriend girlfriend sadly i have the same issue dad will say oh get over it or he will say i deal with it too you just gotta get over it it s not that serious people who don t deal with longing sadness depression loneliness and anxiety have no idea but they swear they do i m sorry you went through this hug it ll get better when you remove yourself from toxic people\n",
            "sorry about that every suffering is valid and deserves to be fully listened to accepted respected only then it can be learned from and you can move upwards out of it if people can t listen it s a reflection of how far they have met themselves if your suffering is not respected it s because 90 percent of earth doesn t take a look inside themselves at their suffering and solve it through the see accept learn pattern instead they suppress and by what they re telling you they re teaching you to continue that pattern of suppression improve yourself before trying to show the people who may mistreat you that they are doing it wrong it comes out of their own unconscious pain so try and have compassion towards that they were taught to cope like that no one can be forced to see this stuff for what it is we have to desire to expand our perceptions i hope some form of therapy or other listeners can be available for you it can be transformative to just be listened to some schools jobs or healthcares have a version which is available free and i ve used it and it is super effective even if it s not the best therapy out there it is so good compared to none some people die of this deep suppression of self and no one ever knew they were suffering wonder if someone ever told them not to complain or their problems aren t significant the best option then is become one of us who is working to heal it within and then spread that around by helping others later you might have to spend a while being the listener for family before they ll hear you ibest of luck patience better better is coming even if it takes work and time it s rewarding\n",
            "i hate it when people do that attempting to correlate their basic emotions and issues to a debilitating and crushing mental illness they miss the point op i hope you understand they don t get it are you feeling okay\n",

            "there s still hope for them understanding some people just really don t get mental health or they ve never been educated on it my family was the same way but if you bring it up multiple times or explain it s beyond normal sadness or tell them their reactions make you want to never reach out to them again they may start learning and listening i ve even told people to do their own research sometimes which can help for them to see my experience written in official terms on websites like psych today\n",
            "it s what they were told as children they re just repeating the toxic cycle our culture is emotionally inept this depression epidemic is not mental illness it s a side effect to the toxic culture we are all subject to in this world it s those who are depressed that have true hearts who can be happy and fulfilled in such an unjust world full of emotional toxicity stay strong sorry you went through that you deserve better\n",

            "not for me though as through sleep i can forget almost all of my problem instantly and maybe get some happy dream probably\n",
            "this is what i m going trough right now too morning causes me so much anxiety it s not even funny i m on the verge of escaping all my responsibilities just so i could lock myself in my room pull the curtains pretend it s an eternal night and slept the day away seriously i m on the verge of locking myself up\n",
            "yes i do i do that all the time cause i know the day will just go bad again\n",
            "yes because i know tomorrow will bring more of the same that today had also sometimes to avoid the dream where i am happy only to wake up and its not my life\n",

            "yes every day i usually wait for my family to go asleep and then smoke weed and enjoy the solitude but it has caused me to skip or sleep through so many classes i have even skipped a whole week of college but i still do nothing about it\n",
            "yes every night i don t want to sleep coz i dont want the next day to start even if i go to bed at 11 i stay up watching youtube videos on my phone till 2 or 3 am\n",
            "maybe the next day won t feel so bad if you got enough sleep i used to do the same thing until i realized that i fucking love sleeping and not being conscious\n",
            "i purposely stay awake because falling asleep normally means i have to actually think about how shitty i am so i just distracting myself from sleep until i can t stay awake any longer\n",
            "this hit me i do this all the time and it s an awful cycle because then i wake up more tired and the only break i get is the weekend then the cycle repeats monday i hate it\n",
            "i go to sleep late knowing i m gonna hate myself the next day exhausted at work\n",
            "yes it makes a lot of sense i have been staying up late doing nothing almost every night because i hate the idea of moving on to the next day wish i have the superpower to stop time so i could enjoy the peaceful quiet night as much as i want\n",
            "i do it sometimes since i was little i ve seen going to bed as a fast forward to when i wake up because i don t dream so some days i decided to stay up late to delay it\n",
            "yes i often stay up late when i am really dreading waking up the next day like i m convinced the longer i can stay awake in my little bubble the more i can postpone facing the reality that the day brings\n",
            "doing now although still not able to fall asleep been a few days and it s awful so sick and weak been a year long battle stay up til dawn to shorten my day and avoid seeing people or responsibilities coast by on bare minimum used to take prescriptions for depression that helped but cant readily get any doctor to refill them now my own doctor has retired shaky all the time cant manage tasks that keep me on my feet for long and usually sit on my couch all day berating myself and feeling pathetic the mind says just get up and put one foot in front of the other i know but cant overcome\n",
            "during winter break my sleep schedule got thrown off i d stay up super late since i didn t have any class i thought that once i started classes again my schedule will get fixed turns out i m still staying up late even when i have morning classes\n",
            "i did this in school and i do it now that i have a job it s like dread in the pit of my stomach that i m trying to avoid\n",
            "i stay up super late cause i prefer the nighttime over anything and can t sleep\n",
            "i just can t sleep i don t stay up late necessarily because i want to but sometimes because i can t do anything i don t care if it makes sense but there are times when i just can t move sometimes and that comes with the byproduct of not being able to close eyes or stop thinking\n",
            "i didn t realize this was something other people did i do this all the time it s that illogical part of my brain going if you don t go to sleep yet you won t have to wake up so soon and go to work again obviously it doesn t make sense and just makes me exhausted the next day but i keep doing it\n",
            "every damn day i watch yt most of the time or look at memes on reddit\n",
            "every day for me i think it s to prolong the feeling of i m not responsible for anyone or anything right now let s stay up\n",

            "yep it s less painful feeling the day is shorter although the problems are still there\n",
            "i do this a lot especially now that i m doing my masters another day means another round of classes and another step towards the next fucking deadline sometimes i just end up staying up to ridiculous times because i just can t bring myself to go through it all again tomorrow and my free time at the end of the day never feels long enough\n",
            "i did this for my last 3 years of highschool i d tell you it s not worth it but you know that and i know you can t really stop but i can say it hasn t prevented me from doing anything so if it discourages you please don t let it\n",
            "i do this every night and i m way too tired i ve been seeking energy drinks and it s working so far for me but i m trying to find a better way all i can think about is the longer i distract myself throughout the night the longer i will feel like i don t have to be at school\n",
            "so far my life has gone through phases of sleeping to pass time and now not sleeping so time doesn t pass so i completely understand you\n",
            "this sounds like me exactly i despise being awake but my mom gets on my case about taking naps so i have to drink coffee all day so i don t run out of energy because being up is just exhausting\n",

            "i have no idea why maybe for the same reason as op but i do the same just like op said it s killing me i find myself falling asleep on my way to school and in classes more and more but i just can t stop\n",

            "i do it every night because i dread my job i feel like it makes time slow down\n",
            "yeah i get what you mean i usually get caught up in the idea that i will oversleep and not make it on time so i stay up late unironically this also leads to me falling asleep and i wind up over sleeping\n",
            "does it almost every night took a toll on me mentally and physically fucked my career up despite all this knowing that there are still people who love me helps\n",

            "i always used to feel anxious as soon as the sun went down i felt like i could do anything and be anyone at night i d get quite hyper and awake i wouldn t sleep at all i still do it now and again when i have a relapse but apparently some of the above behaviour happened when i was having manic episodes\n",
            "i ve been doing this for years and it s just now starting to affect me in my adulthood it probably has been for awhile but the awareness in of itself sucks\n",
            "i used to do that a lot when i was still in school still do it now occasionally but it a different way\n",
            "i do this too except it causes me to sleep all day pretty much i fucked up classes and work before it is tough honestly to break that cycle lack of sleep feeds the depression and depression feed the lack of sleep\n",
            "i used to get panic attacks and stay up as late as i could feeling somehow i could forestall what was certainly impending death that way now i stay up too late because i m trapped in a heavy blanket of what s the point\n",
            "actually it s a little secret of mine only 1 person knows i can t stand the thought of tomorrow of course that there are exceptions i m taking about an average day i don t know if i m terrified by it or just don t want to start another day\n",
            "yes i do this every night been doing this since i was 15 it s never going to change\n",
            "yes and i hate it it seems that if i have to work or have something to do the next day i stay up extra late and somehow find something fun distracting to do all night even after telling myself all day that i m going to go to sleep at a decent hour on my days off i don t want to do anything besides silently complain to myself about how bored i am so i usually sleep for 18 hours and barely get out of bed\n",
            "i ve never really thought of this but yes i am with you i go to sleep at 2 3am and wake up at 5 30am i m always tired and have no motivation but that s how life is i guess\n",
            "i ve been doing this as long as i can remember and i m 31 it takes a toll\n",
            "yes since i was teenager or even before like right now at this very moment another sleepless night\n",
            "i stay up late to avoid the future but also because it s the time that i know i can be alone and a time when i can ignore my responsibilities because it s too late in the day too accomplish anything\n",
            "me i m going to bed early so i don t have to deal with the morning also me i feel so tired never doing this again me the following week i m going to bed early so i don t have to deal with the morning\n",
            "i don t have daily obligations atm so i just sleep in the day and bum around at night boy when i do have something on though it s a pain to stay awake past my bedtime\n",
            "ah that s interesting i kind of have the opposite where the more i sleep the more my brain will be switched off and i can avoid more of the day similar approaches but different executions aha\n",
            "i understand your pain here i m 51 and i still do this way too much i m dead tired all day and feel like shit a lot but around 10pm my body is like let s do this man more factorio mornings are tough with a wife and kids that need to get to school i m self employed so i can hide the fatigue a bit there it s a big challenge to break a habit like this that feeds depression and anxiety best wishes op\n",
            "i hated my job so much that i would do this the anxiety and depression i felt when i knew i was going to have to work the next day was terrible if i stayed up later the longer i could put off the inevitable now i m starting a new job and hoping it s a better fit\n",
            "yeah i stay up as late as i can before passing out i work all day long so i feel as though my life is nothing but sleep and work but if i don t sleep that s okay\n",
            "i used to do the same exact thing but i realized that sleep deprivation probably makes it worse over time makes me tired and feel like shit working shifts doesn t help either because i can never get into a regular cycle some days i don t work some days it s daytime and sometimes i don t leave until 2am to help this i keep otc sleeping pills with me only use them 3ish times a week at most to avoid building tolerance and making them useless also smoking weed helps a lot if it s legal or obtainable in your state country but not drinking studies show it makes sleep worse and overdoing it causes hangovers also if you need to use your phone before bed using the night mode helps don t know if it s placebo but it feels easier on my eyes and helps me sleep some people find it easier not to use the phone at all but watching some mindless youtube video or browsing reddit makes me sleepy staring at the walls does not for me\n",
            "i used to do this until january and now all i do is stay up until 5am and sleep until 3 i feel it shortens my day but i have more time in bed\n",
            "this post is the first one on this page i ve never looked at this page before and it happened to be a post about something i ve done for years i m 47m it s almost kismet i learned over the last few years that i do it purely to try avoid tomorrow the reason i want to avoid the next day is because it s another day of the same crap issues i have to deal with day in day out as soon as i wake up i m filled with dread fear anxiety hopelessness as is my entire day i try convince myself that avoiding waking up to a new day i won t have to go through the above mentioned feelings it s lead to me trying to stay up all night on countless occasions of course that s bull poop my fears anxieties depression lack of self worth along with other things are with me all the time even in my sleep not sure if any of that garble made sense but hey ho i tried\n",
            "me too because being alone in your bed is the best part of my day and i m trying to enjoy it as long as possible until the cycle repeats\n",

            "yes i do that too but for the past year i have been listening to talkshows and audiobooks so it feels like im delaying the next day but i eventually fall asleep d\n",
            "i used to do that all the time when i was super duper depressed i just could not bother to sleep i was too sad and i did not want to go to school no matter what i absolutely hated school not because of the work just because of other things\n",
            "omg this is so relatable and i thought i was the only one having that issue i always have a hard time explaining to people why i go to bed so late when it s basically killing me when the reason is exactly what you described\n",
            "pretty much every night less then before but still partly i used to only have like one hour of sleep every night and it broke me even more now i do get more sleep but still not the amount required yet i hope you can find ways to get some more sleep as lack of sleep will only make life harder but i know it s not easily done i hope it gets better for you\n",
            "i wouldn t say i have depression but this is something i do so fucking much its not even funny\n",
            "i sleep from like 4am 7am latest i ve done is 10am and wake at like 5pm it s fucking crazy i know but i m jobless and no friends so like why should i stay awake for the daytime i try to minimise my exposure to daylight as much as possible bc it makes me think about how everyone else is being productive having fun if it s dark by the time i get up it s like oh well the days over i ll just chill in my room no biggie\n",
            "when i was a kid i used to stay awake because i had constant night terrors\n",
            "this is absolutely me i used to go to bed at 8 some nights so i could wake up at 4am and start my day now i go to bed once my eyes burn and i can t look at my screen any longer\n",
            "yes yes yes i thought i was the only one it s not that i m not tired i just don t want to have to wake up the next day and deal with draining work however it always bites me in the ass the next day because i m super tired as and hate waking up\n",
            "i hate daytime so many things to do so much stuff going on and i just do not have any energy to deal with all this at the moment staying up late and waking up around 4pm works for me so well because in the afternoon and during the night everything is so chill and calm\n",
            "all the time i work a typical 9 to 5 i dont feel alive much right now and the work is not stimulating much either i feel like a zombie that is in automatic mode not much truly excites me anymore either but i want to break away from it someday but need to have something to look forward to it makes the next day the next week more bearable if you have something to look forward to\n",
            "i m not sure i completely realized i did this but i almost cried after reading this\n",
            "yea almost everyday i hate sleeping anyway i m physically exhausted and emotionally exhausted too other reason that i try to avoid the next day is that i hate most of the things that i have to do everyday like when it all comes to an end when will it s all over i just want this habit to end so i can enjoy the next days with joy and not burdens or depression\n",
            "this used to be me i bow stay up late not because of my own will but because i always have shit to study for but i m surprised there are people like me that do the same thing\n",
            "you know what i m right now doing this not necessarily because of a lack of desire to do anything but in this case i just have severe insomnia with my depression and don t always know how to combat that much love and well wishes for yourself as well and of course anyone else doing their best with this day to day as well\n",
            "yes yes yes oh my god yes i thought it was a weird thing about me\n",
            "oh my god just me everyday i fucking hate day even i would have friends i could go out only at night\n",
            "i stay up late because it s the only time i can just watch youtube or tv shows without any responsibilities my sleep deprivation is making my mental state even worse but every time i try to bring up my mental issues my mom tells me i need to sleep more even though i asked about seeing a doctor for my mental issues\n",
            "one of the reason i have sleep deprivation is that i love midnight it s so dark so silent as if time has stop and tomorrow will never come\n",
            "holy shit this is me i d feel like shit the whole day knowing i won t accomplish any responsibilities and have time for myself to catch up on a tv show or finish that book i m reading for fun then i ll stay up late and try to binge a show or something but it still feels like not enough time or i ll just stand there wondering what i should do bcuz it thing that i thought would normally interest me just doesn t anymore\n",
            "im up at 3am right now so i guess im not far off from this i did just wake up at 10pm though and i slept through my first day of summer school i just dont wanna deal with it\n",
            "i experience the same thing and also have this weird thing where i feel like i don t deserve sleep if that makes sense i know if i sleep i ll feel better than if i stay up and wake up exhausted but don t feel like i deserve that also why i haven t been taking my meds recently\n",
            "ditto it s almost like a subconscious thought of well if i don t go to bed maybe tomorrow won t happen or at least just postponing it surviving on 3 hours sleep is killing me though although not literally unfortunately\n",
            "i don t stay up too late but i have found myself just not doing anything on sundays as i don t want the time to go quickly\n",
            "i felt this post so much my cousin committed suicide two weeks ago i know it s grief that i m likely dealing with but i ve felt a major life shift i m lost and have a tough time sleeping myself since the ordeal he sent me a text before he did it i don t know if it s because of that i subconsciously stay awake in fear of missing something important maybe i probably need to go talk to a professional\n",
            "yeah for a few years now mostly because it d finally bring me some peace no pressure of letting people down and no hurt from being let down i also don t think i bring much good to the world so it wouldn t make much difference and lately every day has just been waiting for the next day to come and magically fix everything which seems like a waste but i know this comes and goes and i m allowed to have these periods so i m just choosing to lay low for a while and wait for an up period how s it work for you\n",
            "same i just want to be removed from existence never born never died just slap a different consciousness in this husk\n",
            "every night before falling asleep i wish that i don t wake up the next morning\n",
            "some days but honestly not so much i don t have an urge to suddenly stop existing i really want to know what it feels like to get to stability girlfriend great job friends and traveling family etc but when i compound the reality of what me not existing would do to my family it s unthinkable if i killed myself knowing my family it would literally be like me killing them too life is about energy all of the negative energy and depression i have right now if i killed myself that energy doesn t disappear it would literally get offloaded to my family probably multiplied to each of them individually it s unthinkable\n",
            "this is called passive suicidal ideation and it can be just as concerning as active suicidal ideation if you dwell on it too much and let it consume your thoughts i ve dealt with these feelings for a few years and it s always scary to come to the conclusion that you want to die even if it s not by your own hand i m still working on how to move on from that myself but i hope you can find a means to work your way through those feelings and eventually enjoy life\n",
            "perhaps he didn t commit suicide then because he couldn t conceive of a method that fit the pure and intense feelings he had toward death but method was beside the point if there had been a door within reach that led straight to death he wouldn t have hesitated to push it open without a second thought as if it were just a part of ordinary life for better or for worse though there was no such door nearby haruki murakami colorless tsukuru tazaki and his years of pilgrimage\n",
            "i feel the same way i m too cowardly to suffer the physical pain that comes with suicide and i also wouldn t want to inflict the anguish on my family at all although i m sure they d eventually get over it move on and forget about me it would be a much better choice to just never have existed in the first place should ve swam away from the egg\n",
            "fuck i m on 2 expensive antidepressants are they even worth it i feel like this too\n",
            "yeap all the time i wish i was born a rock or something and i would always imagine myself not existing like i would try to make my mind empty and think about what it would feel like or not feel to not exist\n",
            "i don t want to die but sometimes wish i never was born at all queen\n",
            "same here pretty much if there was a button or something that was just pushed in front of me i d press it instantly it s like when a comic or show has someone presented with a kill a person for a million dollars button or something and the joke is that they instantly press it without a thought unsettling the devil demon spirit whatever that gave them that option only more depressing\n",
            "i feel you i have friends and family that care about me i have opportunities school work but i just feel unhappy most of the time last semester i just slept almost every day getting out of bed was a chore there was just no motivation drive to do anything at all i m too weak willed to off myself however i wish i could just disappear i m not going to amount to anything and i ve unfortunately seen this coming for a while when i was younger i had drive and was passionate about things and i still try to be passionate about things i enjoy but fuck is it hard i m only 21 and this probably seems naive to say as i have my whole life ahead of me but it doesn t look promising i ll just push everyone away shoot down all opportunities and probably have a heart attack at some point sorry for the ramble i get where you re coming from\n",
            "yes completely i don t want to make my family worry or feel guilty as they would if i jumped off a building or in front of a train but i do wish my life would end soon why can t i donate all the years i dont need to someone more deserving i m also overwhelmed with guilt at being depressed while living in a first world country and having zero worries about food and shelter what right does such a person have to ever be unhappy i wish i didn t have to take up space in the world any longer\n",
            "i m curious actually i ve been feeling this way very strongly the past few months but i don t have any other symptoms of depression am i fine\n",
            "half the time i want to just be allowed to take my life i m in a ton of mental pain and living is agony there should be allowed suicides for people who have such severe depression that it feels like living is hell on earth\n",
            "i feel like that too sometimes suicide affects everyone close to you and life can be pretty darn shit so just not even existing in the first place seems the best option at times depression is a fucking killer literally it just drains my soul for years i ve been thinking eventually it ll go away but it doesn t i have ups and downs but the downs can be excruciating i just kinda keep going though don t know how or why but i do there are one or two things i enjoy about life so they make living just a bit more appealing than death\n",
            "i can t simply because i couldn t do it to my kids or my mom but if they didn t exist and my mom was gone absolutely not to say this is healthy because it s not but yes i do feel that way from time to time\n",
            "i just don t want to hurt people every time i think about ending it i imagine my parents or grandparents at my funeral i can t do that to them i don t want my last act to devastate the people i love\n",
            "that was why i drank basically to erase myself they even call it suicide on the installment plan it was only when my resentment toward how drinking made my life worse not better instead of erasing everything did i find help to stop i still have times where suddenly stopping existing feels appealing and sometimes those days go on for or at least occur during too many days in a row but no feeling is forever and if i listen to dumb music i can sing along to or make it a point to notice things like sunlight s reflections or leaves patterns or even just stop and try to picture myself and my surroundings as if i m cinematographer doing a wide angle shot for a movie i m also appearing in weird i know but for some reason works for me i don t want to erase myself at least for that moment i can t i m in the script and have to appear in that shot and at least 5 6 more we re shooting next\n",
            "yup and what i do is i isolate myself from people like today i haven t spoken to anyone except my friend that came by and i feel like he knew that something was wrong with me i generally don t tell anyone when i m feeling depressed but when i feel like not existing i isolate but lately thoughts of suicide have been creeping in\n",
            "my line is i won t kill myself but i wish i never existed all i can say is i hope there is no afterlife nothing worse than eternal existence suffering or not\n",
            "yes i don t want to commit suicide because i feel like it would be a waste of life even though i don t want it i ve had opportunities i know others would kill for and it feel so selfish to just throw it away i wish i could give my life to someone who would appreciate it more than i do\n",
            "ah man are you getting help this feeling turned into wanting to commit suicide pretty quickly\n",
            "yeah that s me in a nutshell i don t particularly want to die but i wouldn t mind it if i just didn t wake up in the morning\n",
            "i definitely feel this way struggled and am struggling for years now i m currently 19 and turn 20 in two weeks i ve felt this way since i was around 12 i was maliciously bullied throughout elementary middle and high school and it sticks with me everyday it s hard to forget and it isn t as easy as people say it is\n",
            "i had thought about what would have happened if i never existed my mother never gets the abortion causing my father to reject her because it isn t his child me not being born my sister not being bor my mother possibly living in a single bedroom apartment because she couldn t afford to take care of the child then again that scenario might not be right either she could have done what her boss at the real estate agency she worked at told her to do and aborted me she could have been really successful working at the real estate agency she could have been living in new york or union city and working one of the big corporate offices for the company making thousands of dollars a week or whatever who knows that s really all i can think of in how my birth ever effected anyone around me i m very insignificant in my life at the moment well i did donate cans of food to some soup kitchens so i don t know some homeless or down on their luck people would be slightly hungrier\n",
            "i don t want to disappoint my parents anymore than i already have by killing myself so yes\n",
            "this is something i deal with too i ve been told the thoughts are called passive suicidal thoughts basically we are okay with the idea of death and dying but we would never act off of those thoughts i m sorry you are dealing with this just take everything one day at a time that s what i am tryign my hardest to do\n",
            "only everyday so desperate that i got excited for the so called apocalypse that was apparently supposed to happen today i knew it was nonsense but a part of me looked forward to it\n",
            "yes i can t kill myself because im a coward and because i don t want to humiliate my family any further so anyone whos willing to kill me now would be a good time plz anyone\n",
            "every day i think about it i would never kill myself and honestly the only reason is because of my father he could never handle that but sometimes i just wish i could run away from everything i could be free far away from home and all the problems and memories i have at that terrible place i just want to be somewhere else and leave i ve been living in england for 2 weeks now and i had to go home for a few days because my grandmother passed away and to be back here just suffocates me and makes me want to cry my eyes out all the time i ve lost 2 very important people this year i arrived yesterday and i will leave in 2 days i just want to go back asap because everything is so nice there there are no sad and bad memories and i feel like i can start my life over i hope moving away from my home country will make it up to the fact that i sometimes don t want to be alive anymore\n",
            "it s actually surprising how many folks feel this way i do for over fifteen years and 3 failed attempts to take my own life twice i went to the hospital to try and get help instead i got beat down by cops because it wasn t worth and i wanted to go home they said nope and the betting began funny thing is i myself was a cop fifteen years into it i got hurt which ended my career the injuries eventually took everything i can sleep or watch tv thats all for the past ten years so many folks are all alone and without hope some of those folks actually aren t in as bad shape as they think mostly the young ones who haven t had a chance to experience life most under thirty who aren t seriously handicapped anyway still have a chance to be something they can be proud of i m 60 i ve did more things by the time i was 38 than most folk do in a life time but in the big picture i have failed at every major event in my life dropped out of college didn t finish my twenty years raised two kids are even worse off than i am there s more but it doesn t matter most folk when they die and have accomplished nothing can say they raised kids who did better than they did that would nice taking your own life is tough people say its the cowards way out it isn t not even close in the state of mind of a person who decides to take their own life they see it as making life better for those who care about them leaving them behind is hard add to that having a military law enforcement background suicide is doubly taboo in my career i talked a couple folks out of putting a bullet in the head of overdosing looking back now i m not sure i did them any good ah well it dont matter anyway i m counting on getting a redo on life after death i dont buy into a god as presented by religions i think we keep doing this life over until we get it right i think i have two memories of other lives and in both i died young one when i was twelve and one when i was seventeen both were such i could go back and verify there were folk who dies as i remember with all the circumstances the same dont know if that real or not i like to believe there is something better after this life once we get this life done right well i guess i had a lot to unload was just going to make a couple sentences and agree with a lot of you if all of us could get together in one place for a couple of days i think most of could find whatever it is we need to move forward kinda like we should all meet at depot bay or on may 15th of 2018 lol i hope all of you who are struggling can find an answer i know its different for everyone some can find help in religion others in art or a career change maybe more education maybe a new job i dont know but for most of you the answer is within your grasp all you have to do is left up your head and reach out your hand be prepared to work for it as almost nothing in this life is free buts its there none the less for the one and half of you who actually read this thank you d\n",
            "i ve been clicking the stop existing button for years since that s a button that doesn t exist i still do\n",
            "it is not worth the bother of killing yourself since you always kill yourself too late emil cioran\n",
            "yes if i could fade away along with all memories of me that would be ideal\n",
            "this so much this i like to think i am slowly removing myself from everyone s lives so they will eventually not even notice i am gone\n",
            "i ve gone from wanting to not exist like you describe to wanting to only exist sometimes right now i feel like crap and have no motivation but if i don t force myself i ll have no food to eat and no drinkable water soon down to a gallon right now i d like to not exist tomorrow i know i ll be fine tomorrow is so far away but when i didn t want to exist at all i was cool with the finality of it\n",
            "there s so much baggage that comes with suicide use a gun nice going now your family will find an awful scene you re an asshole jump in front of a car making someone go through trauma asshole jump off a building traumatize many people awful cleanup scene risk it not working dumb asshole overdose good luck more likely to just kill your kidneys and or feel like shit when you wake up dumb and too much risk hanging traumatize your family when they find you asshole anything involving knives painful as fuck messy asshole there s no clean easy painless way to just leave and to be honest that s what keeps me here but goddamn if there was a button i could press to stop existing i d be long gone a thousand times over\n",
            "obviously i m late but just for the sake of saying something for kinda validating myself yeah i feel the same way that way no one misses me and no one cares so it s all good\n",
            "i ve felt the same way for some time now i m apathetic to everything i don t think i could commit suicide but non existence sounds nice it d be like going to sleep i believe\n",
            "me too i ve toyed with ways to off myself but never as a viable option but if i was ever in the position that my life was in immediate danger i don t know that i would fight it like if i was being mugged give me your money or life i might be like here s my cash if you promise to pull the trigger after we can go to the atm right now\n",
            "i would want to do this ultimately i don t want to feel pain by killing myself and although i don t think anyone around me would truly care if i was gone i wouldn t want potentially hurt anyone life really does suck right now though\n",
            "yea i have the same feelings i could never do it i don t have the courage to do it as i know if i did is immediately be filled with regret while passing and guilt of what itd do to my family friends and girlfriend i just wish something would happen so i wouldn t be in pain anymore i know some of its my own fault im lazy no drive to do anything i ve been suspected of having acid reflux a month ago and have been on omeprazole since and because of it i barely eat as i don t want any symptoms of reflux to happen i just feel like i m existing until they get it under control and feel like a burden on everyone\n",
            "unfortunately or fortunately depending on your outlook and due to the nature of existence as well the nature of self and other you will always be suicide or not introspection into what you really are might help alleviate your suffering it did for me but it s something i continually have to not forget every moment the illusion we all live in is a very compelling one if nothing else know that you will always be okay even during your darkest times good luck with everything my friend\n",
            "to be honest yeah some people like suicide for its shock value but i think most people are just trying to express they just rather dissapear forever and suicide is the closest thing\n",
            "i honestly couldn t imagine self harming the closest is either picking scabs biting nails or chewing dried skin so much i accidentally pull off some fresh flesh and start bleeding it bothers my anxiety because i once burnt myself making eggy bread dropped bread into it and sent frying fat everywhere and my mum angrily asked if i was self harming doesn t really make me feel better about actually talking about my problems i mostly avoid talking about it\n",
            "agree i wouldn t kill myself as it would upset my parents and friends too much but if they didn t exist then i would easily kill myself\n",
            "going on 8 months the same i think its more the fear of pain of the act that prevents it if it was just over that is a different story\n",
            "yes this is precisely what has been on my mind for the past couple of days actually\n",
            "don t commit suicide if you don t want to but if it ever becomes too much and you know for sure you want to find a painless way to do the deed why suffer more than you need to but again that s last resort\n",
            "i feel like that too but i also realize its probably not going to happen i ve actually been considering going through with it because i doubt it will happen without prompting which obviously is not a nice thing to think about but its important to consider that yes people are in these places and people do think these kinds of thoughts\n",
            "since i had my cat put to sleep in march there s just no reason to stick around\n",
            "same i don t want to do it myself because i don t want to put my family through all that but if i had a choice to not exist i d take it within a heartbeat\n",
            "basically yeah i need a third option for existing not alive but not dead but not something corny like being undead i really do not think i m a good fit for this world i find myself in\n",
            "i m too much of a coward to put myself in harm s way or to commit suicide but i wish i was aborted or something\n",
            "absolutely when i was younger 13 16 maybe i used to think about how to build a machine that would erase an entire existence without creating a paradox if you used the machine so you were never born the machine would have never existed for you to use thus meaning you d have to have someone else build it for you to use it but they weren t going to build it anyway without you meaning that again the machine would fail because it wouldnt exist to erase you if you didnt exist to create it anyway yea i dont wanna erase myself from just now and the future but from all of time no one would be upset at a funeral if there was no one there in the first place\n",
            "same i would probably just erase my self from existance then ghost watch everyone be happy without me\n",
            "i ve put a gun to my head multiple times but have backed down because of the risk of not dying from the first shot i would love if you could just walk into a hospital and get a lethal injection that way its more of a sure shot death or ya know the suicide booths from futurama are pretty cheap sooo heh v\n",
            "i wish i could just like hit a pause button on life take some time off you know but i can t because life always moves forward\n",
            "yeah i feel like that some days i don t really want to kill myself but wouldn t it be nice to just sleep forever i just get tired of feel weak and unfocused and tired and meh all the time and it just feels like it would be so much easier if i just wasn t here i m trying to focus on the things that make me want to live though food baking my cat nature if i were to sleep forever i would never get to see my cat s sweet little face again or go hiking or make and eat sticky buns it doesn t always work but sometimes it helps\n",
            "yeah feel it from time to time not killing myself but just not existing if i could look even deeper in the problem i d say all i want is somewhere i don t feel pain and lonely and all the anxiousness and depression of the moment that s usually what makes me want to stop existing for a moment\n",
            "i was speaking to a counsellor the other day about this i feel the same he asked me outright if i d thought about it and i said if i was living alone by myself no friends or family yes but because i ve got a good network of friends and solid family i wouldn t because of them only\n",
            "i talk about this a lot with people not existing is 100 fine with me it s the getting there that i want to avoid\n",
            "same feeling here i got an awesome job car salary i can travel the world yet iam alone iam not committing suicide because of my mum wish i could just vanish\n",
            "i feel this way too my therapist describes it as can you please stop the train i d like to get off here it s a really tough feeling to experience happiness feels extremely far off from me\n",
            "i go for periods where i feel similar i feel that if i was to be in a situation where death was inevitable unless i took some form of action i wouldn t do anything to stop my death i was actually in a situation like this during the summer i was driving around 1 am and a oncoming car was swerving into my lane swerved out at the last possible second and i just kept driving straight as if the car wasn t there\n",
            "i have tried 6 times and failed 6 times hospitalized mental once at this point i just wish i could afford a hitman one in the head and done\n",
            "i d give gold to this post if i could but i can t so i ll just say that s such a great statement and it really says a lot as well as all the 1s that have been brought upon it mine too and it makes you realize that you re not as alone as you may think\n",
            "it just seems so much less stressful you don t know you existed once if you don t exist\n",
            "exactly how i feel it feels good to know that i am not the only one having such thoughts it s okay other people are having a hard time too is it easier not to feel altogether\n",
            "id do anything to stop existing even though i am talented and have loads going for me i just think human existence is a fucking joke and nihilistic dread exists for a reason if you look at it logically life is the most pointless thing there is and we may as well not bother\n",
            "it s really weird when you say it this way existing is such a pain in the ass there are all these different meters up i ve got to keep filled up not existing on the other hand bliss i m not suicidal i m just saying i can relate with the op\n",
            "yes i feel like if i just stop existing everything about me is wiped away and people live as if i was never there everyone would live happily my biggest wish most wanted superpower has always been to be completely forgotten\n",

            "i would love to stop existing that s something i ve thought about for years i ve attempted suicide multiple times in the past i sometimes find myself being upset that i didn t die any of those times life is too much sometimes\n",

            "same the weird thing is though i keep seeing people kind of happy and that annoys me so much i can t even tell you i m 23 and how the f are people my age finding motivation to study to do their work from home job etc when i can t even find the energy mental strength to get out of my bed\n",

            "i had a close friend cut me off because of how i treated her right before she ended the friendship i was suicidal and depressed at the time though just a month before she cut me off i attempted suicide and i nearly made a second attempt right after she cut me off but i backed out because i saw people nearby\n",
            "yup my mood has been in the dumps for the past two days after a period of being a little better i have friends who don t know too much about my depression and how i isolate and stuff and so i fear they wonder why i m not texting back as much i fear that they ll think i m rude or that i don t care but i m just exhausted and i don t have the energy to let them know why i m being so unpredictable\n",
            "i hate that feeling its awful its lonely i m sorry you re feeling this right now i want you to know that its ok that you re not ok you re not alone in feeling this you won t be not ok forever so just try to take care of yourself as best you can for now i ve found that letting my loved ones know that i m in a bad place helps a lot its hard to do at first but it gets easier over time and they will start to notice the subtle changes after a while too it helps them support me when i m honest about why i m a little rougher around the edges than usual i hope you re able to find lighter times soon\n",
            "yeah it s bad i sort of had this but in fairness i think i should ve dealt with it better i can think of an episode before i hit rock bottom but i was definitely on the way down at the time i didn t see it or recognise it and even when i recognised my depression it still took years to understand what went on i only understood once i realised i had aspergers but going back to the episode and this was about 20 years ago now a friend at the time really wanted to go to this club and was on at me to go so i said i would i was having a bad time and the energy was just draining out of me on top of that i d been working all week in a job that was really hitting my mental health and i got to the end of that week and i was burnt out i didn t have the energy to get out of bed and communicate i couldn t even really explain what was going on to myself let alone think about it enough to be able to explain to anyone i didn t have the energy to think at all i was living at home i hadn t told my mam of my original plans so she wasn t there to prompt me i was scared because it was the first time i d experienced this i told my mam i d been drinking after work and had a hangover so obviously i left my friend dangling outside this nightclub and he wasn t best pleased my mam took a message from him he was angry and never wanted to speak to me again i felt disgusted in myself i felt embarrassed about the phone call my mam had taken but i had no energy and couldn t explain what was happening or why to myself let alone my mam or my friend or anyone as far as i was concerned i was a disgusting person and a failure and i didn t deserve to have friends we never did speak again and i still feel shitty about that i know how to cope with depression now and that helps with my aspie burnouts i do think the two are linked i don t have a lot of friends but i do have a couple if we were going out and i d cry off i d tell them and they d get a bit pissed off at first and they d be come out for a drink it ll do you good or you need to come out of your shell but because i knew what was happening i felt i was able to fore warn them because i was managing my burnouts as time went on i was able to explain a bit more i still don t think they fully understand but we re all in our 30s and 40s now so they re more accepting and when we do go out it s a bit quieter not out as late and one or two pubs and or meals rather than big pub crawls or nightclubs which i find much easier that s not a hatred of large crowds by the way i ve been going to football matches since i was a kid without any problems and i m ok with gigs too but i ve always felt lost and out of control in places like nightclubs they have triggered one or two meltdowns\n",
            "i m sorry you feel that way i m going through the same thing right now actually a few months ago i was feeling suicidal and at a really low point i blocked my friends off all socials and deleted my accounts they thought i hated them but actually i just wanted to push them away so they wouldn t get hurt by what i was planning on doing i came back and apologized for blocking them without saying why i did it i don t think i owe anyone an explanation of how i was feeling especially bc they re not the type to understand depression and suicidal thoughts they forgave me and said it was in the past now none of them text me anymore and things won t ever be the same\n",
            "i feel this i ve been shutting myself out a lot lately i have zero contact with my friends they don t call me nor do i in fact at this point i don t even have friends i guess i don t go out my room and sit with my parents because they won t have anything else to talk about other than criticize me at this point i feel like i can t even share an opinion without getting any criticism i literally feel lonely and i remember how i was there for everyone but nobody is here for me now i don t know how long can i live like this shut in my room not talking to anyone i just wanna get out of here literally\n",
            "i feel your pain i will say this if you are on medication it could be no longer working or you need something added if you don t take medication you really should consider it i stopped taking a certain depression med a few years ago for blood pressure reasons but i thought it was no longer working and wanted to see if i could live without it i still took an anxiety med and i thought it would be good enough i didn t change all at once but over the years my path felt darker and darker i should have taken the hint something was wrong when i got fired from a job i was at for 15 years because i abused fmla i 100 take responsibility for that i just couldn t get out of bed hardly and i have other health issues that make me tired on top of that so i figured it was more due to that illness than anything mentally i was wrong it s just that my mind comes up with wack excuses to not do things when it s off balance i just imagine the worst things right off the bat i continued to struggle to survive until a little while ago i finally had enough i felt so despondent i am lucky to have a few friends and a so but what was i to them but a fleeting face once in a while i don t like depending on others especially for depression issues because i don t want to bring other people down with my brain s bs because to me that s what it is part of it is growing up in an unstable household and part of it is genetics i didn t want to depend on meds either but it was either that or drown in darkness and i realized from taking the med hiatus for depression that i can t not have chemical help and so be it i deserve to be a whole individual not a ghost it s been 3 weeks since i started on depression meds again and i feel different already placebo or no i don t care i left my house for the first time socially in 8 months it felt great one small leap sure but a world of difference to me now i am thinking about switching careers too maybe i need to plug myself into learning something totally new and something that could benefit me in the future even if it doesn t work out i m going for it because now my thought is it only has a chance if i give it one there s no way my brain could have believed that before so i say to whomever is reading this you can get help something to give you a hand up and start helping yourself so you can really be present when you re with other people so you can stop struggling for air and finally begin to walk so that yes you can run\n",
            "this happened to me the first time five years ago i was in a band with some really close friends we were almost gig ready and my mental health took a sharp nose dive i asked for a few days to collect myself during those days the leader of the band called for a band meeting i thought this was to talk about the possiblility of looking for places to play this wasn t the case as soon as the leader arrived he said that collectivly they where going to remove me from the band the reason was that i was using depression as an excuse to slack off during the week and they couldn t rely on me this was a huge blow to my self esteem it took years to gain any confidence to play music again i have only just started to pick my bass guitar up needless to say i m better off with out those people in my life silver linings and all that sorry for bad grammer tldr got kicked out of band because depression\n",

            "howdy wanted to add something positive to this thread having experienced exactly what you re talking about i can tell you that as you work your way out of depression your brain will recover slowly as well it takes a little bit of time the brain requires stimulation in order to perform well which is why it seems that during phases of depression you are thinking acting slower than usual personally i went through 7 8 years of not stimulating myself due to depression as i m recovering i find myself able to think much more clearly and quickly i definitely feel a lot smarter hang in there and try and find something that works for you recovery isn t easy but even a small improvement over weeks can have great effects and remember if you have a bad day during recovery that s ok focus on what you can do now in order to make things a little better for yourself best of luck we all have faith in you\n",

            "my memory fails me mid conversation i ll be saying something and just completely forget what i was saying i struggle to concentrate reading a book watching a movie i don t like groups of people at social gatherings as i feel abnormal my worst issue was today went to costco with the kid walking back to the car i told him i think i forgot to lock it not only did i not lock my car i left the engine running for close to two hours i have absolutely no idea how i managed to do that\n",
            "i don t know whether it s memory decline or whether my memory isn t functioning the only thing i can compare it to is when you re blackout drunk you don t remember anything because you don t form any memories even though you can be grand all night talking away to people i sometimes can t remember whole weeks and it frightens me hope you re okay\n",
            "definitely it feels like i m losing my memory and my intelligence from depression which is actually one of the biggest reasons i m depressed i got depressed enough to start feeling dumb and then that made me more depressed so now i m basically braindead i mix up dates and times and i get caught up spelling words sometimes i wish i was dead\n",
            "yes with the medication im on for anxiety and depression i forget things regularly in one sense it sucks because im forgetting my life but on another level i have really thought about this i like it because id rather forget and be numb than aware and in pain\n",

            "i ve noticed a huge drop in memory attention and understanding i also lose control of my speech and fumble with my words quite frequently where i used to be pretty well spoken i ve considered depression as a cause but the more i think about it the more extreme cases come to mind like brain tumor or some atrophying disease i try not to focus on it for too long\n",

            "yes but i think it s cause of how i ended up coping with depression which was by sort of muting a lot of things i don t really react in any strong way to stuff anymore so like being surprised or etc good or bad i try to stay in this neutral zone i fear being happy for a moment since i know it is just a moment i fear going into the negative emotions cause that spirals out of control i don t eavesdrop multitask etc or really pay attention to anything besides the single task i would be currently doing at the time lots of alcohol which i haven t drank in over a month now with no withdrawals and also no positives have come from me stopping and drugs in general too to help keep me balanced in my own way i don t feel like i ve grown dumber but i can easily lose track of stuff in the middle of a sentence or if i m interrupted etc it s not really forgetting completely since i can be reminded and it comes back it s not like i don t remember it entirely it s just actually drawing it back on my own is a bit weird at times i m pretty much always aloof as well i barely even talk to anyone including at work the only person i talk to regularly is my gf and that s easy cause we live together to add to this though i don t really flex my memory ever cause i don t need to really not in school or anything so i might even think that would be more the cause than my depression or anything this may be unrelated but i also have always had horrible spatial awareness so i don t even drive or anything lil ptsd from a wreck is in there too i can t remember directions etc and never really was able to i ve had depression since i was very young like 5 so it s hard to make a distinction between before after depression started ruining my life\n",
            "good gods yes and i am uncertain if that is the main culprit or if there is some kind of alzheimers or parkinsons or what who knows what a life of depression can do to your brain it can t be good\n",

            "i used to be able to remember quite a bit but for a long time now my memory has been very shitty i either repress memories or in most other instances i ve genuinely forgot a lot about my life even lately my memory has gotten worse than it was maybe even a year ago\n",
            "my memory and cognitive functions have declined recently some think it s depression i think it s a brain issue tumor or maybe even cancer somewhere\n",

            "i am not diagnosed with depression yet but i ve felt it for a long time now i have short term memory loss i do feel like i ve become less sharp clumsy too i wondered if it had anything to do with my anxiety or depression\n",
            "yep i have quite a bad problem with this if i ever get set off by anything my mind will basically erase the day which is quite troubling if it has to do with a person as i can t remember what they did specifically but i know it was something it makes it very hard for me to address the issue with the person and discuss it to prevent it happening again\n",
            "depression is highly associated with poorer encoding so yes it impacts memory i m sorry you re experiencing that i imagine it s like being in a foggy haze at all times while people still have standard expectations of you\n",
            "i dunno whether it s depression or lupus to blame but it does feel a lot like i just feel apathy and don t pull in the information so like i ll be aware i was told something but for the life of me won t be able to remember like i just don t care to store new information i also have found i don t have the focus i used to have even sitting down to play a game i don t have the ability to just do\n",
            "i ve had the memory decline thing i ve been recovered years now and it still affects me i saw my doctor about it and she said it was very common nothing else ever came of it i still have a bad memory sometimes i genuinely forget entire days and people have been like dude really just kinda happens\n",
            "a huge amount easily lose track of what i was thinking or gonna say i can t keep track of conversation details can t remember much to anything about it afterwards it sucks because i forget simple stuff for my job like 2 seconds later i used to enjoy writing drawing and reading now i don t have the brain energy for any of that i like gaming but never bother reading any of the dialogue because i just forget it as soon as i read the next line i m still living with my parents and because of this i don t think i m going to last very long after they pass away\n",
            "i think i can attest to this when i am in a funk of depression i definitely notice i can t recall words as quickly and i use a lot more verbal pauses which i use virtually not at all otherwise i did actually just notice the other day when i was greeted by a fellow student from an evening class i take for four hours twice a week it took me 12 minutes of nonstop thinking of where i knew her from i genuinely couldn t remember then out of nowhere i remembered her name and that she s from my class it was very strange and kind of scary i see her often and we sit near each other and have worked together several times i m only 28 now but sometimes i do worry about when i m elderly\n",
            "you can build yourself back yes you ll lose brain functions i guess but believe me i know what it s like to lay in bed all day with zip going on in my head you can get back to yourself though through time and effort do not give up you got this stay strong side story don t know much about memory destroyed me own through pills sadly\n",
            "yes i get really bad brain fog and have trouble concentrating on discussions and reading material i feel like i m not as sharp as i used to be even though i m not nearly old enough to be dealing with age based decline i feel like my attention span is shorter but that may also be because when i m depressed i often flip through social media and streaming apps somewhat restlessly impatiently to distract myself with new stimuli now i m working on reading more and using my phone less playing music writing drawing different things to keep me busy and use different parts of my brain more actively\n",
            "definitely i think i m becoming dumber i write everything down because my memory is so poor\n",

            "before being depressed i aced all of my classes in university effortlessly i could memorize a 20 digit number after hearing it once my professors said i was a genius depression robbed me of the mental vigor i always had a part of me i deemed inalienable but boy i was wrong i slowly picked myself up depression was the hardest test i ever took in my life because it s not a test of intellect or knowledge but of grit and perseverance if someone told you that smart people can t be depressed they don t know what they re talking about\n",
            "i forget things i want to remember or at least be useful so i can find some work i keep remembering things i want to forget like it never existed\n",
            "oh my gosh yes i remember when i first started having distinct symptoms of depression that raised a cause for concern which i shortly then went to therapy and got the diagnosis for but aside that it was hard to miss how much my memory declined i was struggling memorizing things for tests forgetting to bring certain items to school it got to the point where my room looked like a crazy persons because i had stuck all of these reminders on the walls of my bedroom just so that i wouldn t forget it was bad as i grew up though my memory improved while i was getting more help and entering recovery\n",
            "recently i feel like i don t know my friends and i don t know why i have a relationship to them i could be dissociating but i feel like as i sink lower and lower into depression i start to forget the things that come most naturally to me\n",
            "oh yes absolutely in my case and i m only made more aware of my lack in memory recall when speaking to my colleagues who are mainly lawyers\n",
            "yeah the last 10 years of my life have been a blur i can pick a few pieces out but i don t remember what happened i keep a journal for this reason it was especially important for breakups because i would forget both good and bad things that partners had done\n",
            "i feel like my memory and other cognitive functions do get worse in my depressive episodes for me i think its more a factor of my eating and sleeping habits than the depressive and intrusive thoughts i tend to eat a lot less and sleep a lot more not a very good studying combination\n",
            "not with memory but with talking to another person i stutter so much now and worse is having a lock jaw everytime i panic while talking\n",
            "i have both depression and adhd so i can t really tell which is the cause sometimes i had a lot of brain fog recently until i finally got back into treatment and started taking welbutrin again i am still having a lot of confusion and such but the fog seems to have lifted for now\n",
            "the odd thing is was is happening to me even though i m feeling way better and happier than a year ago it s weird\n",
            "yes definitely because i m in severe pain every day my doc said that also doesn t help my memory situation a lot of my childhood i don t remember my doc did say that those memories will come back after about a year of being depressed and really suicidal i noticed my memories we re leaving and i had a hard time remembering things i did during the day i ended up getting 12 ects and that made everything worse it s not 9 years later and i m not suicidal anymore and i m starting to get memories back remembering things throughout the day or names still isn t good just be patient memory and memories will get better and start coming back\n",
            "hmmm i have declined in memory ability over the years always attributed it to the approximately ten concussions i have had but who knows maybe the depression has something to do with it only has gotten worse for me\n",
            "oh yeah without a doubt i can t even remember simple things like what i ate for lunch or what the weather was like yesterday people tell me that i tend to say that i forget a lot of things and it worries them especially cause i m so young\n",
            "i definitely did i thought my brain was damaged then i got on meds went to therapy and have slowly started to get my life together i ve only been on my meds for a month and i have already noticed progress and signs that my good judgement is coming back my interest in learning and retention\n",
            "my memory has turned to utter shit the past couple of years i can barely remember a day ago used to be somewhat bright as a child with an excellent memory\n",
            "i think depression has fogged up my brain beyond return i feel like im drifting throughout the day and i cant put any hard thought into anything its hard to bring up memories because they ve gotten to blurry\n",
            "i ve noticed it takes more will power to remember especially if it s events from before 5 years ago\n",
            "absolutely i am a very intelligent person went through school up to a masters degree i had bipolar depression and could manage my symptoms very well for years then i went into a deep 4 year depression over time it made me dissociate from reality so often that i couldn t keep track of a conversation i would go in and out of being present but i still seemed normal it got so bad i couldn t remember things day to day couldn t remember words i wanted to use in a normal conversation couldn t remember things i was supposed to do didn t have any prefrontal cortex stamina for reasoning and planning im finally coming out of it now and i can describe it as living life without one of your senses like sight or hearing then getting it back and going wow this is so much better\n",
            "for as long as i can remember with my depression i ve had an awful memory even for the littlest of things it got even worse when i started taking medication for depression anxiety i ve brought it up with my doctor and he said that memory decline is a common symptom of depression and with the meds eventually i want to be able to improve my memory but i ve settled with the fact that that won t happen until my depression improves and i am at a strong enough point to stop taking medication you re not alone\n",
            "i have but for me there are some days that are actually really good though most days are awful on those days i always try to do some reading watch educational stuff etc if i m feeling up to it to try and keep my memory in shape ever since i started noticing the problem hopefully i can recover long term and get back to my previous intelligence but for now just taking it one day at a time and not caring about little things like how book smart you are is important just focus on doing your best with whatever you can that s all you can do or be expected to do\n",
            "my memory s always been trash but yes i do feel like it s gotten a bit worse the past few years\n",
            "wait i didn t even know that this was a thing sorry if i sound ignorant but is it really possible to have memory decline if you re depressed\n",
            "yeah i find it very hard to study when my brain is filled up with the thoughts of having to live in this world\n",
            "long term is fine but short term is very bad i barely remember anything from school two days ago i forget what was said in a conversation i just had a couple of minutes ago and i\n",
            "when my depression was at it s worst i would lose memories entirely people would bring up conversations i had with them that i couldn t even remember having i looked into it and it turns out that serious depression can have a negative effect on one s memory even causing memory loss been on anti depressants for a while now and haven t had those memory loss issues since\n",
            "yeah my short term memory is absolute crap now i still work and have to move for more than an hour a day and i still have brain fog\n",

            "i m really trying to study this and figure out why i think it s because there is something psychological that happens and we re overly conscious about what we can and can t remember it s all anxiety induced which in chronic condition will change brain chemistry and the way your gene expression interacts with the environment essentially i think through our constant doubt in our abilities we condition ourself to thinking we re incompetent which gets reinforced through our already flawed roadmap\n",

            "yes depression very much affects memory chronic stress impairs it source it is concluded that endogenous depression clearly impairs memory function as measured by wms and tests for retention and that in accordance with this recovery from depression eliminates the impairment of memory more hippocampal shrinkage was pronounced among those for whom depression started early before the age of 21 as well as people who had recurrent episodes professor hickie noted that it was this persistence that does the damage those who have only ever had one episode do not have a smaller hippocampus so it s not a predisposing factor but a consequence of the illness state it s interesting that none of the other subcortical areas of the brain have come up as consistently so it also confirms that the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to depression there s a lot more of course it seems to be reversible once depression is lifted\n",

            "i lost a good part of my iq and had difficulty even understanding the conversation at one point i m back to my usual self and brain function now it s possible to beat depression without meds but you have to first look at what you eat your sleep your activities and your self talk relapse happened to me when i notice i got a lot of stress from work and couldn t get enough sleep for a couple weeks found out gluten played a heavy role in our moods\n",
            "in my nearly 40 years i ve said i forgot more in the past two years than all previous years\n",
            "i m not sure whether it s from the depression my many years of self neglect or my 20 years of hitting my head off things or with my fist my short term memory basically doesn t exist outside an employment basis and my long term memory is suspect at best beyond age 20 xd\n",
            "oh yeah poor memory forgetting things going to pay a bill and finding i already did but have no memory of it foggy ness of thought poor concentration my mind feeling like it s wearing heavy gloves and fumbling around for those thoughts i need to pick up and put together\n",
            "brain fog is insanely common with depression and is seriously one of the most infuriating and horrible syptoms for me in particular\n",
            "yes there are things i cannot even remember happening for instance people leaving my home to do a thing and returning to my home i looks surprised when they walk in because even though they specifically said they were running a quick errand not 10 mins ago i have completely forgotten i have just realized this fact recently now i feel less crazy\n",
            "this so this i swear i forget things i ve done like directly after i do them\n",
            "i was really badly depressed in high school during my junior and senior year generally and i can t remember half the things i did or experienced my friends will reminisce with me about our high school days and sometimes i have no idea what they re talking about and i graduated in 2016 i think some of it has to do with becoming dissociative as a means of survival just trying to get through the day\n",
            "this has been happening to me lately actually seeing a doctor about it on monday it s been negatively affecting my job performance over and beyond my employer practically encouraging chaos and acting like you re the problem if you aren t stupidly positive about all the mismanagement and favoritism going on\n",
            "yea massively it gets to the point where i can be told to do something and go to do it and forget before i even get to it when it s in the other room my mind would wonder and just get side tracked actually one of the reasons i got kicked out of the air force\n",
            "for sure went from straight a s to c s within two years every function is more difficult when you don t care enough to perform basic tasks my memory and interest in learning went to shit i practice by memorizing songs that i like and by writing\n",
            "i ve noticed a massive drop in intellectual capacity i even make typos a lot more often now when i m typing i m just hoping it s a sign that things will start to progress quicker now and i won t have to be aware of all this bullshit\n",
            "can t remember where my car parked almost everyday had to look in mirror at least three times before changing lane when driving\n",
            "yes and i gain weight rapidly so i went to a doctor and i had thyroid test but the test showed that everything s fine with me ps i didn t tell the doctor about my depression but he asked if i have enxiety or insomnia and i lied\n",
            "yes and dumb i don t know why i say the things i say harder to understand normal things i forget things mind always floating in the void and friends laugh\n",
            "absolutely i normally have an amazing memory but recently i ve just not been able to recall a lot of things\n",
            "i try to think of what i need to say and then the anxiety hits because i can t think of the word or words i need that i know by heart and have known for many years i tend to stay quiet now\n",
            "yes i was actually reading a few articles published by doctors that depression can cause an shrinkage in the memory part of your brain i have it so bad it use to worry me but now i joke about it and call myself a 92 year old trapped in a 21 year old body\n",
            "yeah when i was at my worst i completely lost track of times i thought we were wednesday and it was friday that kind of thing so i use to forgot conversations i had deadlines events\n",
            "i do probably because the mind is too focused on depressed state and totally forgotten about the supposed to remember stuffs even daily used to become forgotten all the mind remembers is what you i am depressing about\n",
            "i honestly don t remember most of college or the years after it and i m talking about the times when sober and clean\n",
            "definitely especially when i m in the middle of an episode last year i was severely depressed for a period of at least six months and when i try to remember certain things events relationships with people my own thoughts and feelings at that time i completely blank i can t remember much at all my ability to use hindsight is completely shot and i can barely remember anything from that time when i was severely depressed when i m doing well with my mental health my memory is usually pretty good i can remember stuff that i did a few weeks ago without much trouble but whenever i get bad again then my memory is out of the window i don t know why this is maybe it s due to the fact that depression takes away my ability to think outside of myself and take in my surroundings it s really sad because there are huge chunks of my life that i can t remember no matter how hard i try i can t remember falling in love for the first time i can t remember how i learnt to grow into my own skin it hurts but i know that with more therapy i can try and dig up these lost memories\n",
            "yeah and i ve managed to deal with it i m not back to my previous level but i ve learned to pace myself and do things more efficiently so i don t need to push myself as hard really it s only noticeable if i have to work for a long time without break i can t do it anymore i ll start shutting down whether i want to or not what worked for me is talking myself through tasks it helps me stay focused i think in short duration i m actually better now at concentrating than before as for memory i do need some time to recall things but most of the time it s not that big of a hindrance i can t remember old events that well anymore but well it s fine what i do need to remember i still have to deal with daily anyway what really suffered and i think is impossible to recover is my general readiness though that might just be me getting older\n",
            "i can barley remember the past 6 years its gotten so bad i have a little highlights reel of all the bad things that have happened and dont remember much thats good i feel like they exist but i cant remember them life just feels like a dream at this point so yeah\n",
            "oh man this one pisses me off so much my brain forgets the most basic shit after 5 seconds which infuriates me only spiralling myself deeper into self loathing\n",
            "i don t know if it s due to depression but i think it is i used to be good at public speaking especially extemporaneous speech and debate now i ve developed a really bad stutter and i can t pull out facts right off my mind for extemporaneous speeches or even articulate my thoughts well and quickly i noticed i don t perform well in debates anymore so there s that it just feels that my mind is working double or quadruple than it had to and it that it has slown down i attribute it to my depression but i m not quite certain\n",
            "i have noticed some memory decline but the major part for me is massive cognitive decline it feels like my mind is trying to move through molasses like my mind used to be able to run but not it is trying to run with a giant lead block tied to it my mind has always been the biggest part of me i could always retreat into my mind i couldn t trust anyone else but i could trust myself other people would lie to and hurt me but i wouldn t do that to myself i couldn t be honest with other people and open up to them but i could always be honest to myself with depression it felt like someone took a knife an cut out the biggest part of what made me who i am the place i could always go to be safe was gone the only one i could ever trust and feel safe was gone my cognitive decline is one of the major things that leads to my suicidal ideation the biggest part of myself was gone the place i was able to go and feel safe was gone the thing that kept me sane and helped me get through life was gone i have seen some restoration of my mental ability with treatment for my depression but i doubt it will ever return to where it was before depression and that is a reality i struggle with every day medication helps clear up some of the cloudiness but it doesn t help my mind work like it used to tms transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy helped my mind work better but that benefit ended about a week after the treatment did cytomel a t3 thyroid medication that can also be used to treat depression has made the biggest difference in making my mind work better but the benefit is still minor at best meditation helps keeps my mind in check and from spiraling out of control it is really difficult knowing the biggest part of myself is gone and only a shadow is left i m learning to live with that but it is hard i know other people with depression have had better luck restoring their mental faculties than i have so don t take my being unsuccessful returning my mind to normal functioning as what will happen to you\n",
            "yes it does get better i don t know if it s scientifically proven but my theory is that depression consumes so much of our brain and thought processes that it inhibits memory learning focus etc\n",
            "it s a natural occurrence depression being a chemical imbalance and potentially a defect of the amygdala itself causes cognitive declines during depressive stages in some cases cognition may not return in it s entirety the hippocampus which is responsible for the storage of long term memories shrinks due to repeated returning depressive states using your cognitive functionality to a higher degree will see the hippocampus begin to reform to it s previous size and depending on how strenuously you use your mind even increase the size of it and other respective areas of your brain i have experienced such side effects myself with each passing event of this sort due to how avidly i like to use my mind for various things such as learning new information skills etc i have found my mind is far more capable and efficient than it was a year ago and so on even amidst what others would consider as severe depression\n",
            "yes i believe that you focus to much on the depression and it s hard to focus on a conversation you re having with someone it s like your in a daze it s almost impossible to be creative during a bout of depression it takes all you have to just get out of bed let alone be productive and creative but if you don t get out of that bed it s going to take you over quickly good luck to you\n",
            "all the time i actually didn t think this was a depression symptom until i saw this just thought i naturally had the memory of a goldfish like i forget long term events what i was going to say conversations i ve had etc basically everything\n",
            "yes i noticed this when i started to forget some information about texts for class i finished reading them and i couldn t say what is the text about even short and simple texts until this i thought that i just couldn t read with propietly and i needed to practice more but one day in my job i forgot the password and the email of the web that i was designing i worked in this web eight hours a day throw a month and even so i forgot the email and password it was very stupid say to my boss i can t login in the web because i forgot the email and password i have never written this things in paper so i lost all the work of one month and i needed to started again in a new web and domain sometimes i feel like literally i don t have brain\n",
            "i think it is mainly because i m depressed i only have 2 main thoughts either thinking of dark thoughts that drive me deeper into spiral or a blank nothing that helps me feel better than complete sadness while in either of these thoughts it s nearly impossible to penetrate anything else into my brain and thats why i don t remember anything because honestly i wasnt listening or seeing what was happening\n",
            "definitely depression itself medications extra stress all play a part meds can be changed either in dosage or otherwise after i spent what felt like a lifetime on the net under cognitive deficits and depression i decided it was time to talk to the doc about what we could change about my treatment thank goodness\n",
            "yes a lot i can t remember a single thing from yesterday when i used to study that was the only thing i d remember\n",
            "yes very much so i was diagnosed with severe depression ptsd and it got so bad i couldn t remember having conversations with people or seeing them from a day prior i was tested cognitively for memory retention during therapy and was below average and they asked simple questions like listing 5 things and i couldnt repeat them all in the right order it s improved a little now it comes when your ability to focus gets better but it s still not what people consider good memory in the past it was so bad it actually worried me i thought i would need to get help because i was getting scared\n",
            "i completely forgot about a pretty big work project i worked on a year ago and didn t even remember it until a coworker pointed it out so yeah\n",
            "my depression has been worse recently and i can t remember shit and its finals week yee haw\n",
            "yes i had tms and a neuropshych test to try to fix it the nerurophyschologist recommended re evaluating my medication and cbt therapy but i ve been through so many meds i m limited at this point trintellix is the only med even being studied to possibly help this i had some mild improvements on it\n",
            "i had to leave my advertising job because i couldn t hold conversations well anymore and i dont think my seniors bosses really cared or even tried to understand which hurts a bit\n",
            "yeah i noticed that i am really bad at conversation than before and i can t really remember things except bad ones\n",
            "i ve noticed recently i can remember a lot like i used to and i never thought of this but i bet your right and i bet that s a symptom of depression\n",
            "yes this is the hardest thing for me i also really struggle to concentrate i m studying for a master s and want to go on to a phd mostly i ve been doing what i can and desperately hoping that the total inadequacy i feel is my head messing with me and not actually true\n",
            "yep i can barely remember what i did like 20 seconds ago it s hard to come to terms with but i ve just accepted it as part of my life my memory basically gets worse every week im 20 yrs old if that s important\n",
            "don t know if true the memory loss is caused by hippocampus shrinking and it s an defensive process of the brain the brain knows that s something is wrong depression and it shrinks the hippocampus on purpose so you can t remember bad memories but you end up having problems with remembering anything so it s like brain wants to protect you from the depression but ends up impairing your cognitive funcions f ex memory concentration span quick thinking that s what my psychiatry professor said in a simplyfied way i study nursing i tried to find research about hippocampus shrinking but ended up having problems with reading very long medical articles and lost my concentration depression is hell of a drug xd i have also problems with memory i don t remember what i did yesterday i have problems with learning for my diploma and i m scared i m gonna fail the exams 3rd year last semester here and even if i pass i m scared that i won t be able to take care of my patients as profesionally as i could or should and the responsibility is getting heavier and heavier on my shoulders at the moment\n",
            "yeah its really fucking with me i m so forgetful and the days all seem to blend together if my kitchen wasn t a mess i wouldn t remember what i ate yesterday i couldn t tell you what happened throughout august i ll start making a cup of tea then forget about it for an hour i ll write things down i need to remember then forget to check them i forget to take my meds which makes everything even worse my concentration is really poor too i ll read a sentence then forget what it said before i ve started on the next one i have trouble staying present in conversations or remembering what i wanted to say i ve gone from getting 1 1 s in most of my assignments to just scraping by with passes partly because the effort of concentrating on my work is so exhausting its weird cause pre depression everything seemed so clear and my memories feel far clearer and sharper everything from 15 onwards till now 23 is a lot blurrier and harder to look back on\n",
            "i have not linked it but now that you say it that totally makes sense i wonder at times why i have such difficulty recalling my previous days or even hours sadly\n",
            "yes it s actually making feel really shitty i ve been feeling like a dumbass and i can t remember a lot recently and there are times where it s difficult for me to grasp simple concepts that i would ve been fine with before it s really not making me feel good since my mind used to be one of the only things i felt good about myself for\n",
            "i ve been depressed my entire life didn t realize it until my really late teen years i can t remember my childhood i m the butt of the joke in the family becuz anytime someone brings something up i m the only one that can t remember even tho i was supposedly there\n",
            "i notice this very painfully every day my family says i m always repeating myself it s like being in a dream no sense of time or what just happened or yesterday i forget that it hasn t always been like this i ve started making notes to help me remember things better i hope things improve for you\n",
            "yess i m so glad someone said this bc i didn t know if my memory getting shitty had to do w my depression i sometimes forget what i m talking about mid sentence and have to ask the person\n",
            "yes i don t have clinical depression but i was very depressed september october and somewhat through winter i literally don t remember much at all from september november maybe your brain doesn t want to remember the bad parts i also had short term memory loss where i just couldn t keep track of basic things or remember things on my to do list\n",
            "oh yeah my sister was explaining ww1 to me the other day and i had to get her to repeat the things she had said like two seconds ago i can t remember what i ate for dinner yesterday or anything in the previous weeks sometimes i can t even remember what happened at school which isn t good because i need to get homework done\n",
            "omg yes shit i thought it was so weird that it happened thanks for sharing this and yes it happened to me like i am known for remembering shit i have a wonderful memory usually but fucking depression i don t remember much of the good stuff even the neutral stuff like birthdays are a nightmare\n",
            "yes i definitely have noticed a decline in my memory i think part of it has to do with doing the same thing day in an day out not really caring much about anything or paying enough attention to want to remember i don t really have any routines which i think is part of the memory problem i basically get out of bed once i ve slept enough average 10 12 hours make breakfast turn on the computer sit there until i get hungry make some food eat go back to the computer and repeat until i m tired or realize i have to get some sleep then repeat the next day it has been like this for years and is probably the main contributing factor to my memory decline changing things up like talking a walk interacting with people about meaningful stuff etc is out of the ordinary so it s much easier to remember if that makes any sense\n",
            "totally i m on university and i swear my memory has diminished due to my mental health\n",
            "yes i noticed recently that other people seem to remember things in much more detail than i do after some introspection i noticed that not only is my memory bad now but so many of my cognitive functions have been shot like processing information it takes me a while to grasp even moderately simple concepts or if i have to follow a train of information i get distracted or just stop processing even if it s my own trail of thought i never used to have this much trouble before and i freaked out when i realized this i ve been trying to research how i can improve my cognition i started keeping a journal that i write in as much as i can it s helped so far but i still have a long ways to go\n",
            "yeah been depressed since elementary school i can t remember anything from ever i don t even remember what happened last year especially\n",
            "i cant concentrate on simple tasks like paying bills online i forget to keep my card ready and will forget things like what i ate for lunch i ll go call someone to discuss something specific and just forget the point of the conversation\n",
            "yes i have huge periods of time where i black out and so just major gaps missing from my timeline and i also discovered that i have attention deficients not fully adhd diagnosis that i have had all of my life but had been previously able to overcompensate for when i was high functioning but because of the depression i was hardly functioning at all and my attention problems became really prominent and i got some testing done and the dr was able to figure out that i have attention and concentration and focus problems hat are unrelated to my depression symptoms cuz those can often be symptoms of depression too but that i didn t know about these before cuz i was so high functioning so that s why it s not an official diagnosis but it s still treated in the same way\n",
            "so glad i m not the only one i get very embarrassed because my friends will ask me questions about things i ve told them or even things we ve done together and i won t remember i ve taken to just saying i must have been mistaken then about 30 minutes to an hr later i ll remember whatever it is i was asked lol i also blank out during conversations but can engage with a podcast or music just fine anyone else have this issue\n",
            "as of recent times i ve been told i often repeat that i don t remember or i don t know i don t know if it s about things that i actually don t care about or just i have a low attention span\n",
            "definitely it s gotten so much worse everybody says i have the shittiest memory i m basically dory from finding nemo tell me something and in 5 minutes i ll forget\n",
            "yeah it s ruining my fucking life i don t even know what to do anymore\n",
            "yes sir depression has absolutely destroyed my mind thoughts are sluggish short term memory is almost non existent and holding a full blown conversation is near impossible this just kills your self confidence and makes you feel isolated and rejected by society pushing through the brain fog is a never ending battle and one i cannot quite conquer just makes life feel lonely when you can t even socialize in the slightest the need for being accepted is strong now i ve seen some improvements over the course of 3 years meditation is a boon clears your mind and gives you that boost to push yourself through the day not a permanent solution but it does help\n",
            "i legit don t remember anything from conversations hours prior to my hobbies or interests don t ask i don t know\n",
            "this is one of the greatest side effects of my depression i ve been depressed for a good 4 years now i think and i m doing a masters in university however i don t feel like i know anything or learned anything i m quite afraid of talking to my professors because i simply don t remember anything of their classes my therapist says its all part of it but this couldn t come at a worse time why spend all that money on education when i don t seem to remember anything i learned\n",
            "i literally have the memory of a gold fish i forget a lot of words as they ve said them i ve literally had people ask if english is a second language it s my only language it frustrates me to know end that i m not as eloquent as i want to be let alone what i used to be i get whole sentences in the wrong order i sound like yoda\n",
            "yep have the worst memory ever and often forget extremely common words eg promotion when people ask me questions i m not expecting i seem to forget every word in the dictionary and just mumble and stutter makes it so hard to hold a conversation and probably makes me come across extremely ditsy\n",
            "this i used to write and imagine things and escape to other worlds ive literally had conversations where ive forgotten that ive said heard something already to the point that my friends tease me about it they dont seem to understand how scary that is\n",
            "i was on the bus to class one day and i saw my high school friend she asked me what class am i going to and it took me a good minute to remember what class i m going to\n",
            "i haven t personally experienced this but my church pastor who used to experience depression before she got saved used to have bouts of memory loss where she was walking around in public and she lost consciousness of what she was doing until she finally regained her consciousness a few minutes later\n",
            "my sister has bad depression and she got in a big fight with one of my friends in front of me and the day after i was talking to my sister about it and she knew they weren t friends anymore but it was like she completely forgot what happened or anything about what she said or did and it was the day after and she forgets things a lot and blames it on being high but a lot of the time i know she s sober so it s weird\n",
            "holy lord above for the longest time i thought i was losing my mind which was making everything so much worse\n",
            "every time i talk its like i lose my own train of thought mid way and i ask my friends what i was talking about so i could cotinue and the decline is huge sometimes in math tests it happens mid way through my solution and its so sudden at the beginning it was a steady decline now its like a rollarcoster if someone knows how to get through it plz reply\n",
            "it s at the point where it interferes with my job relationship building and my studies i can t even calculate someone s change without asking the customer to open up the calculator app when the till acts up i can t remember the most simplest shit like a coworker s name and we ve worked together for a couple of years i always forget my best friend s past words of comfort every time i drift from her and she chases me with reminders of how much our friendship means to her self loathing partnered with memory decline s a mean ole beast\n",
            "my brain disappeared there is no other way to describe forgetting the beginning of a sentence by the time i got to the end not being able to read anymore forgetting what i was saying in the middle of saying something forgetting people s names while speaking to them people like family significant others etc but it s coming back now i used to devour books before and now i am stupidly inordinately proud of having read three books in the past 2 months i m crying because it s so pathetic but it is an achievement i hadn t read a whole book in 9 years i am hoping everything comes back keeps coming back for all of us\n",
            "i can remember my first day in kindergarten like it s yesterday but i can t remember what i really did yesterday\n",
            "i ve lost my memory completely of almost everything besides the past 3 years i ve started developing a stutter if i m not completely focused i can t accomplished anything outside of just good enough\n",
            "absolutely this is extremely common in people with depressive illnesses your brain retains information that you consider to be important when you are depressed nothing registers as important so your brain doesn t bother holding onto anything the good news is yes you can and will return to your previous cognitive level your brain is not damaged it s just not registering anything as important to hold on to when you deal with the problem that is leading to your depression your brain will pick up where it left off\n",
            "my mind became a scrambled mess and life became mind numbingly boring i had no interest in doing anything which resulted in me zoning blanking out frequently throughout the day\n",
            "i don t have depression but i do notice that when i m sad i care far less about everything i think the more i care about something the more likely i am to remember it\n",
            "i use to have really good memory like i can still remember when i was 3 we went on a helicopter ride i dont really remember what i even did yesterday except for lay in bed all day everything seems so foggy\n",
            "i don t want to sit here and tell you how sorry i am i d rather say that you are right she wouldn t want you to be sad over her death is something that everyone experiences for example my great aunt was one of the best woman i ve known and recently i went to south dakota to see her in the hospital and she was strong all the way through even after having multiple strokes and i remember her cussing at the nurses for sticking her with iv needles telling everyone that she s fine and she can go home then the day after i left south dakota she passed i couldn t move i was so depressed but my grandmother reminded me of all the good mementoes and we laughed and cried and even got angry but that s all ok because she would want us to remember her for who she was not how she isn t anymore\n",
            "with what i am going through now i swear this made literally cry i am just so sorry\n",
            "i m so sorry was it unexpected i hope she did tell him how she felt\n",
            "my therapist who i d been seeing for almost 6 years and the first one to really help me moved to the other side of the world about a year ago his wife started a job revolved around stopping sex trafficking she s an incredible person and i m glad she does the work she does i cried and cried for weeks i still miss him i can t imagine if he passed away i m so sorry for your loss\n",
            "i can t possibly communicate how sorry i am for you loss is always so very hard especially with people you re close to wishing the best for you\n",
            "hey i know it s not much but one of my favourite musicians lcd soundsystem james murphy wrote a song about the very thing you re going through check it out if you re so inclined it s called someone great\n",
            "i m sorry for your loss and wish you the best remember that grief is part of the healing process and the memories and love you felt are very much still alive i know the pain of losing someone you rely on emotionally and it can be quite confounding but finding your inner peace is the most honorable way to respect her legacy\n",
            "i m so sorry that s a special relationship that takes awhile to build and even rarer to click with them maybe there is a way for you to reach out to her family like sending a letter to the place she worked so they can possibly forward it letting them know the impact she had on you may help everyone find closure\n",
            "ahhh the feels yes she will want the best for you and if anything she taught you a very important life lesson we don t get many second chances in this life and one decision can change your course in an instant it is bittersweet but hang on to what matters and it will guide you 3\n",
            "i m sorry for your loss and in awe of how you are handling it 3 keep your chin up and remember you are loved\n",
            "oh man i ve never conceived of that happening thank you for sharing big hug to you\n",
            "i m really so sorry try to honor her in any way you can and you re right she s still in your corner\n",

            "just be down all the time lol then you never have to relapse 10 years and counting\n",
            "i think this quote sums it up perfectly for a long time in my life i felt like i d been living two different lives because the truth is in the life that only i see who i am who i really am is someone who struggles intensely with depression because there s this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong when you break up with your girlfriend when you lose a loved one when you don t get the job you wanted but that s sadness that s a natural thing that s a natural human emotion real depression isn t being sad when something in you life goes wrong real depression is being sad when everything in your life was going right kevin breel\n",
            "i also feel you i ve found it really helpful to remember what depression is and isn t at least in my understanding i have no medical or psychological training just going off my own experiences feeling sad down some other negative emotions are a natural part of life and actually help us navigate the world sad scary other negative things happen in life and feeling negative emotions is a normal and helpful response if my feelings correspond to the reality of what s going on i m not too worried that my overall mental health has taken a downward spiral it s when my feelings don t match whats going on that i take special note and maybe start to think about where i can find support if i need it when my metal health was at its lowest point i barely felt anything at all good things didn t make feel good sad things didn t make me feel sad etc spent more of the time feeling numb but negative feelings were easier to access so i would deliberately dwell on things of try and make myself feel awful just so i could feel something i now understand that pattern of thought as being something akin to emotional self harm i had cbt as well as being on meds and it massively helped break the cycle as i started feeling better any kind of feeling was evidence that my mind was functioning better and my mental health was improving even negative feelings felt weirdly good as i was able to see that they were appropriate responses to what was going on in my life don t know if that s helpful for you op but mainly wanted to say that feeling down isn t necessarily a relapse and so isn t necessarily something to be scared of if by relapse you mean that you ve felt worse in the past but are currently feeling better then it sounds like you will have learnt lots about yourself and your mood so even if you do have something of a relapse you re in a much stronger position to manage it well know how to help yourself and how to ask for help hope you re doing okay\n",
            "i m depressed for over 2 years now i am visiting psychiatrist and taking meds so i suppose it actually is a real depression but still every time i somehow menage to do something right i feel like maybe i am overreacting do i even have a depression do i need those meds and everything starts to look better and then i am struck by life 2x harder than it should be and i have no idea what i am doing wrong sometimes i feel like it s all pointless but i know i need to fight we all need\n",
            "i lost my shit recently my cup literally poured over and i cried hysterically in my car for hours then i cried over happiness because i realized it wasn t my depression it was actually stress and sadness as crazy as that sounds i completely understand you it s so hard to decipher what your sadness really is is it your condition or a natural reaction from that experience i realized just like someone said in the longer comment you will start to tell which is which when your sadness doesn t match your current situation and you take note of it it just sucks that it takes a couple episodes for trial and error lol hope that kinda helps\n",
            "i suffer from depression and one of the ways i fight back against it is martial arts training it s interesting how the body and mind correlate thoughts and feelings i bruised a rib a few months back and didn t even realize it for weeks because it felt very similar to the chest pain i feel when i get depressed i thought i was getting depressed again and started training even harder to fight it i kept pushing through it until it got so bad i couldn t breathe or bend over and i realized it was a physical problem my depression feels like a rib injury i guess\n",
            "i never let myself think that it s the norm that was something i always told people in group therapy this is not the new norm we re all going to have episodes but we can always keep going we love you and support you\n",
            "i was just thinking about the same thing and then i opened reddit only to see your post i m someone who is very sensitive and gets upset easily and for a very long time i didn t believe i was depressed now i know that the constant heartache i was having was a big signal that it was indeed depression for some time the pain is gone and i only feel it from time to time this reassures me i m in the clear but in those moments when it does come back i get anxious and scared i just try to remember it s temporary it will go away it should\n",
            "i feel you this is was me everyday when things started to seem to be getting better best of luck to you bruv\n",
            "at this point feeling down is an optimal state for me when things get better that s when i m on guard cause i know that shit s gonna go down eventually sooner or later\n",
            "same have i just been having a hard time these past few weeks or am i having a relapse the world may never know good luck\n",
            "i feel this in my soul its like living on a knife edge with constant anxiety and fear never knowing if its just an off day or if its the start of something really bad if you need someone to talk to i m here\n",
            "1000 same i say this all the time another scary thing is knowing that your happiness is finite and that another relapse is inevitable\n",
            "this is literally how i feel right now i ve been off meds for over a year but recently i feel like i m relapsing again but at the same i m not sure if it s just a temporary thing and i m terrified because i seriously do not wanna feel like that again\n",
            "i think about this a lot i have spurts of consciousness where i am happy and almost in third person like this is different problem is instead of enjoying the natural happiness i start worrying about when the depression and sadness will hit again\n",
            "this i recently finally went off meds and have slowed down my therapy but whenever i get down or having a week where i m too tired to do much there is a little voice that panics thinking i have relapsed something that helped was she went over the mind over mood depression test with me we did that when i was first seeing her and when i had a really bad spell after getting better she did one again with me pulled out my old ones and we compared them together with the newest one yes there was some mild underlying depression things and 1 2 things to keep and eye on but she reminded me i was doing way better even if there is an underlying here as long as it doesn t get worse i m still on my way to recovery it made me feel heaps better\n",
            "it s terrible i know you feel as if you can never tell what kind of day it s going to be\n",
            "i can totally relate to that feeling and of course we typically go with thinking it s going to be the worst case i ve learned to not question it so much and just go with it whatever it s going to be i try to stay active distracted force myself to move and stay connected to the outside world and people that care about me in some way\n",
            "currently me i feel like i m going insane none of it makes sense i start counseling again on sunday it s hard trying to express this feeling only thing that comes to mind is numb my thoughts and memory is shit i hate work to the point i haven t been getting there on time call in i have no friendships and i m barely present for my kids its an exhausting routine\n",
            "i m trying to practice living one day at a time mind you a day can start great and one small thing crushes me so there s that\n",
            "i like to tell myself if i could make myself get better before i can do it now it make take weeks or months but i will do it often depression feels like an endless cycle of recovery and relapse but if those periods of happiness exist i ll stay around for them and maybe one day that happiness will stay for a long time and bad moods will just be bad moods instead of relapses\n",
            "oh god i know what you re talking about i ll be like is this just for today or is this the start of a slump that ll last for months\n",
            "i m currently in the relapse phase and it is not a fun place to be\n",
            "i hear this a year ago i thought my meds weren t working because some stuff had happened and i was getting depressed ended up going off those meds and trying 6 different meds that didn t work only to go back to what i was on a year ago and feel better again it was a temporary reaction to life not a depressive episode next time something like that happens gosh i hope never of course i won t be so quick to change meds\n",
            "i think my worse is when happiness anxiety kicks in as in ive had such dreadful events happen not long after a happy one that i get high anxiety from being happy like if i m happy someone i care about will die or meet a bad situation after i told my therapists all the bad things that happened in chronological order she said you ve seriously had a streak of unfortunate events couldnt have been more closer to the truth than that\n",
            "i m forever feeling down so when things go wrong i make sure i try to stay grounded\n",
            "i m currently in this loop right now am i sinking into depression due to this being the time of year that my life took a horrible turn back in 2016 and 2012 ooor am i about to sink into another horrible suicidal depression despite things being fine woo who is excited to find out\n",
            "yes to this and confusion of wondering am i depressed or is this just the way it s suppose to be you ask others and it s either no response with a confused look like why are you depressed or the dumbass comments of snap out of it either way it sucks\n",
            "that s me except for me when i m happy is when i get worried i worry if it s just a manic episode or if i m truly getting better\n",
            "its like in mario brothers it s a new wall to jump over a new pipe to slide down you ll get to the end eventually and completely intact don t worry\n",
            "ahh my favourite game hitting the gym more often or even just moving can get endorphins going for you hope things go well\n",
            "yes i have a permanent fear of relapsing depression ruined my world twice i do not want to go through it again although i m still depressed i am functional and i am terrified of becoming unable to function again\n",
            "every time it gets bad again it s hard to remember if it ll ever get better then it always does for at least a little while\n",
            "scariest part of deppresion for me is you cant look back for happy moments because deppresion finds a way to corrupt it hey there is me and my friend haley haley cut herself for years and you didn t do anything about its your fault she bled out with slit wrists\n",
            "i don t think i have distinguished the difference between depression and reactions to life they seem to mesh together into one giant ball of shame and despair\n",
            "does anybody else walk around how do i look like a big truck passes by ears think i bet my head could founder there but you only have a thought for like a split second and it weird you out\n",
            "the thought of it brings me to tears and i m not exaggerating reading the title has me crying out of fear i m so scared of relapsing i m terrified i ve been a whole year without antidepressants a whole year not feeling like everybody would be better off without me and i m so scared of relapse\n",
            "its always temporary just very hard to see your way out of it i m struggling with depression too but through consistently trying to improve my point of view the day to day slightly improved something about the way we were brought up through our experiences we develop our owne way of perceiving different situations i feel like we can improve on this by acknowledging where our sadness is coming from and working to improve our reactions also exposing yourself to new experiences help to change your point of view get out of your regular day to day that might be supporting you negative habits or reactions it s been about 2 years for me where i m trying hard almost every day to make improvements and i m only really now seeing slight improvements so be diligent but remember to love yourself for who you are dont think to much about the past or future and focus of what s making you happy today\n",
            "i usually know before i start to relapse but i still freak out if i feel down if its only a reaction\n",
            "i don t that s really the right or most helpful distinction depression doesn t exactly make you sad it makes you more vulnerable to a downward cycle when something triggers you and when you ve been down that road multiple times it s easier to fall back into those patterns of course this is an oversimplification too every upset could be the start of a relapse practice self care stay active\n",
            "it s best not to think about it thinking about it just feeds it makes it worse at least in my experience doesn t hurt to try\n",
            "i feel that very often i don t even know the root caught cause but when i m alone\n",
            "i m 54 3 bouts of major depression over the last 20 years and at 1500 hours of therapy with practise you can actually get pretty good at telling what s an appropriate emotional reaction and what s depression\n",
            "true and when you start to get better you question yourself do you really have depression or are you just lazy\n",
            "and you become weary of your moments of true joy you can t even enjoy them because you re afraid the downfall will be even worse you question whether you ve ever genuinely felt happy im making a point of writing down little moments where i have been because it s impossible to recall from memory apparently\n",
            "i am dealing with this right now i feel myself sliding down that deep dark hole\n",
            "i know i always do my best to recognize the early signs and pull myself out\n",
            "when i start to feel down i have to control my thoughts and not think of other things that will worsen my mood if i don t do this then a snowball effect starts to happen and pretty soon i m depressed about everything and in the middle of a relapse\n",
            "it s like walking a tight rope every day for every little thing oh and it s on fire too\n",
            "the first time i could recognize one of those dark weeks ahead of me i couldn t avoid repeating the phrase a momentary lapse of reason over and over in my head and remembering that image of a person in front of it self burning alive\n",
            "oh my god this speaks to me on so many levels i ve been hyper vigilant lately so i feel like it turns into me talking about how i m sleeping more or how my internal monologue had gotten increasingly darker which leads my therapist to treating symptoms i think idk so far i m still handling it but it s like propping up a cake with my hands i get one side but chunks keep slipping now i m getting weird about eating and dude s probably going to suggest eating healthy or something just gah\n",
            "being medicated for the last 6 years or so i no longer have this fear i have times of being a bit flat but no longer any deep depressive episodes\n",
            "i m at that point right now i think it s a long way down from here for the foreseeable future\n",
            "i feel this very hard i get angry first and easily agitated i try not to take it out on people but i try to figure out what s wrong so i can stop it it s really hard for me to pinpoint which makes me get reckless more frustrated with myself and suicidal then just lazy cause i dont wanna move this is me now and i dont wanna be a ball of self hating sadness fury\n",
            "i think im spiraling down again rn it happens every semester which means theres a pattern i know these things i feel are just my brain and do not accurately represent the real world but that doesnt make it hurt less\n",
            "since i got it i have had crazy mood swings mostly crying which is something i don t do very often since i am very closed off emotionally and i only cry when i m drunk but after hearing that this stays with you your whole life and you can relapse i cried more than i have my entire life i have only been depressed for like half a year and i m already tired of this shit to think i can be doing great later on and it could just hit me again is not something i wanted to hear\n",
            "at this point i think i l always be prone to having depressive tendencies whenever my friends and i watch a sad movie st the cinema they cry and shit but get over it real quick and i m left with a heavyness in my stomach and an awful fucking feeling of sadness that makes me want to go to bed for a week straight i can t handle sad songs or films or books i guess that s just the way i operate but i don t think it s normal i already recovered though so these episodes aren t that frequent however evert time i suffer from one i wonder if i ll be easily triggered for the rest of my life\n",
            "whenever i think that i am feeling good or happy i m scared and automatically think that i m faking everything and then i get depressed not funny at all it s like i can t enjoy happiness because i think i don t deserve it\n",
            "yes it s very rare to meet someone that i feel comfortable with i usually feel like an outsider and like i dont fit in i long to belong though lol\n",
            "always it s a sinking feeling nowhere to go no one to confide in i m used to it by now but it hurts\n",
            "yes my whole entire life i feel like i never fit in and very rarely relate with anybody i m always the outsider\n",
            "you aren t alone i feel like this constantly someone once on this sub described it perfectly they said something along the lines of i feel like for example my life is a sitcom and i m just a backround character while the rest of my friends family are the main characters this describes how i feel right on the dot because i always feel like others view me as insignificant or just an alright friend aquitance i feel like i don t really have any motive to move on in my life because if other people don t seem to care about me why should i\n",
            "a toxic combination iam feeling very often on one side i want to be like a shadow and don t want to be seen because i am shy and anxious on the other side iam feeling alone and unseen it s like everyone is walking and i stand still a feeling of alone in the crowd of people paradox i can feel you brother or sister\n",
            "yes i do too it s so hard on me i feel like i don t belong anywhere and don t have a home or a place to go\n",
            "yes i know we re not supposed to compare ourselves to other people but i m 27 and i haven t connected with people since i was 13 16 i feel stuck in that teenaged mindset which is when i got sick and i started becoming a recluse i can t connect with people my age i ve never been a social butterfly and i m just constantly aware of myself and i constantly berate myself even when i was younger i was aware that i didn t fit in with other people it s just become worse over the years the worst part is the people i do connect with i can t physically meet up with\n",
            "oh god good to know that there are people who are going through the same and understand bruh i feel ya no matter where or with who i am i always feel like i m in a wrong place like i don t fit here i d love to help you but i have no idea how i m also struggling if you need someone to talk to about it let it out feel free to talk to me\n",
            "honestly i feel like this is part of this mental illness i always have long periods of time where i drop off communication with friends because i feel like i just don t fit in with them anymore but when i tell them how i feel they re always shocked and say that i m just being hard on myself it s so nice to know other people go through this\n",
            "i have been feeling like an outsider especially around my friends i was feeling like i was being pushed out like i was rejected talking is hard for me and i have social anxiety so sometimes being outside has its benefits but overall it is a really negative feeling\n",
            "yep it s a weird paradox i don t want spotlight on me but at the same time i hate feeling invisible\n",
            "i m a college student as if college wasn t an already tortuous experience i ve been feeling like this for a long time i do have friends go out to parties and stuff but everything keeps feeling deeply fake and empty i can t seem to get along with people anymore without feeling like i m bothering them in some way i feel i like if other people feel immediately disgusted towards me all the time and i just can t help it\n",
            "yes for some to live in the light some are deemed to live in the darkness i know that feeling too well like there is no place for me nothing at all noone and nothing waiting in the future life that will end anyway will lose any meaning right now it doesn t have any happiness is something taken away from me so unwillingly i became the opposite of it like the counterweight made to suffer and that way maybe when existence end so will my pain\n",
            "a yearning to belong then again i think i ve been in places where i might actually belong according to everyone else there but i don t feel it\n",
            "yeah i don t belong anywhere i m invisible ignored and people lose interest in me i stay by myself to avoid drawing too much attention to myself with so much anxiety i m afraid to go out into society because i might embarrass myself after all i not needed on earth i m just an outcast that is there all alone\n",
            "yea i do it s like i m a bg character just reciting the right lines over and over again i hate it\n",
            "i feel like that too and when i try to get out of my comfort zone and try to get out there more be more talkative etc i always end up feeling rejected and like people are not interested in me and don t like me\n",
            "the only place i fit i feel like its on videogames because you get to be someone else\n",
            "did i make a new account and write this in my sleep cause this is exactly me i feel like i don t belong anywhere\n",
            "yes it just gets worse i thought once i left high school it would be ok but literally nobody new talked to me when i went to university nobody now i m basically afraid of people because i know from experience they won t like me\n",
            "yes i have all my life i think one has to get used to it because it s probably true that some people just can t fit in\n",
            "yes this broke me and made me the quietest human ever until i graduated high school my thing was that i always knew something about me was different from the rest of my friends and family and at one point in high school was actually 100 convinced that my parents were paying my friends to hang out with me they weren t i was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that was why i would draw back from everyone every now and then that s why i got more excited than everyone sometimes and laughed louder what i thought made me some psycho age regressed teenage child was actually mania coming into swing this part might sound stupid but getting that diagnosis just lifted a weight off of my conscious i m still 100 that person but knowing why i m that person has allowed me to love myself for me and it s been the most beautiful transition of my life i m not saying yours is caused by an undiagnosed issue and i hope it s not because this isn t easy despite learning to love myself through it my advice to you as easy as this is to say though much harder to implement love yourself look in the mirror every morning and say it out loud i love you me make lists of the great things in your life and what you love about yourself and find your passion if you love your hair work with it learn to do cool shit with it gardening do that just do something that makes you feel you again you come to notice that when you fall in love with yourself you come out of the background you were just an extra in the movie but then you get a promotion and you get the lead role and then one day you ll look back over the past few months of your life and you won t be able to think of a scene in the movie that you weren t the star of just whatever you do don t give up because you will become the lead role you just have to find you first\n",
            "deadass bruh i m an awkward person and i have friends but i never feel at home anywhere i go to a christian college and ion even believe in that lmao\n",
            "i ve never felt like i fitted in as well almost like iam a separate species to other ppl if that makes sense\n",
            "i very much feel this way i m in my early 30 s and feel so out of touch with my peers and definitely with younger people it s a really lonely feeling especially when everybody else is moving forward and settling down\n",
            "i overcame my depression and constant feelings of not fitting in and belonging with meditation i was a mechanic and approached the whole thing in a very mechanical way until i found the perfect tuning for my body and mind and you know how the story goes you get those two right and the soul reveals itself similarly to how you have gauges on your car for the various mechanical systems i discovered there are levels for our body mind and soul as well this made it really easy to fine tune the tuning process i know there are many masters out there who swear that you need to learn from a master to really get meditation right it s not like we need to go within and re engineer everything that s highly impractical body mind and soul 3 gauges only 5 levels each it doesn t get any easier with the right tuning it s like clockwork you can pretty much set it and forget it that s how wonderful our humans really are i just focused on the tuning method and simplified it so that it s easily repeatable and tested it out with difficult situations 3 gauges only 5 levels each body mind and soul it doesn t get any easier eventually nothing phases me anymore people circumstances i even had the opportunity to test it out in court and just sat there and tuned myself the entire time and everything just went my way it felt like the judge and i were being connected the ruling was better than i had wished for i did get a little too excited during the end though now everyday i just take a few minutes to re calibrate and get realigned mostly after my meals not only did i overcome the depression and anxiety everyday is like a dream i m happy for no damn reason and i can feel it in my heart it s like a real sensation coming from my chest the technical term is the heart chakra and it has something to do with energy i don t care about all of that though i just know that it feels really good and at any moment i could burst into tears of joy for i am so blessed\n",
            "same here it is common for people with depression to be like that because they don t like talking about certain things like depression or anxiety but would like to talk to others because they want to distract themselves by talking 5o others but like i said earlier they are afraid of them bringing up the thought of depression\n",
            "to me i am a wanderer i come having fun and go without anyone notice from place to place person to person there is no home and i know that one day this journey will end as i collapse somewhere in this vast world with no cry from me and for me it was a terrifying thought but also a comforting thought\n",
            "most of the time i feel like mentally i live in another dimension compared to other people\n",
            "same here i never fit anywhere and i hate to pretend to fit into a group but the loneliness gets to me sometimes\n",
            "all the time i actually sit and convince myself that it won t be worth the heartache to go out and do something because nobody will want to be with me anyway\n",
            "nah i seem to fit in just fine i just feel nothing about fitting it it doesn t make me any happier\n",
            "felt like this for the longest time i think maybe now it s just a mental thing however when i was younger i was never wanted even by people at school i literally stopped going to school and no one cared to even check up on that\n",
            "i feel this too i always feel like the one who s left behind who s forgotten about i feel like no matter what group i m in i m always sticking out like a sore thumb like i have to squeeze in to somewhere that i don t fit just to be included my coworkers usually talk with each other unless it s just me and one other person i feel like i can t get a word in with my friends sometimes and feel like i m just dead weight it makes me feel incredibly lonely\n",
            "yes i ve felt like this pretty much my entire life i don t belong or fit in with anyone or anywhere else it s like i m a side character in my own life instead of being the protagonist\n",
            "same but i think it has to do with the loss of identity i remember reading somewhere that years of prolonged depression causes it to become internalized and as a result you experience identity loss i always feel alienated from everyone around like i just don t connect with them so i pretty much just isolate myself all the time\n",
            "yes i m 23 and have felt like this way my whole life i feel like this around family coworkers and my friends all the time i didn t even feel like i belonged in church when i was a kid teenager the place where you ll supposedly feel the most welcome i dreaded going to youth group especially because i wasn t friends with any of the other kids i just wish i wasn t so socially anxious and introverted thank god i have my best friend of 11 years by my side i m still here because of her\n",
            "all the time even with my own family that s how bad it is for me\n",
            "and when someone approaches me and tries to befriend me i freak out in a hamster put in a bath of water\n",
            "this is me for sure i can easily be in the spotlight but i don t have you ever taken the myer briggs personality test it really helped clear some things up with why i am the way i am maybe try it out\n",
            "i think the thing i hate is that when i finally do meet someone i can feel like i belong with them or i can be comfortable with theres always complicated situations surrounding that person where it hurts to keep them in your life jealous friends or they move away controlling so etc does anyone else have this happen to them or is it just me i feel like i m looking in the wrong places but at the same time it s rare that i genuinely connect with people and its smarter to just not associate with them because it hurts me more\n",
            "yup i always feel like the odd one out even with family there s always that disconnect like i m not truly a part of the group\n",
            "all the time i constantly feel like i m an extra in other peoples lives this guy who you get on a season or so who then is suddenly killed off while there rest of the star cast roll on\n",
            "i m probably an ambivert but it can definitely feel this way when you re only friends with extroverts its so easy to just slip into the background noise and disassociate lmao overall you don t need a million friends you just need a few that make you so comfortable and happy that you re not even thinking about when you re gonna go home or how long it s been\n",
            "yes always an outsider looking in never comfortable never at ease always on edge i m just not one of them i m too different and theres something wrong with me they notice it too and react accordingly i m allowed to be a part of the social circle but i m always on the periphery nobody takes me seriously and people don t ever actively want to be around me they don t mind if i m there along with the others but none of them want to spend time with just me and even if they did it wouldn t be very fun i m not a great friend to have and i get super uncomfortable and quiet around people i m not already very familiar and comfortable with a few rare exceptions notwithstanding it s that whole being alone in a crowd thing can be surrounded by people but can t connect to any of them i m just a ghost blending into the background an insubstantial observer to the world and everyone in it part of me likes it that way hidden means safe unnoticed means you can t be hurt but it is so very lonely i feel so empty inside\n",
            "for me it s a feeling of being separate from other people i barely feel human most of the time and trying to interact with and relate to other people feels like trying to relate to another species it s awkward when i m around others i feel like an alien in a poorly fitting human suit trying and failing to disguise myself as a real person and everybody knows i don t fit in walking around in this human skin i ve no business wearing i only really have one friend compared to other women my age my social life has been pathetic other women by the time they re my age have had relationships have friends and a lot are married by now i don t actually want the whole marriage and children thing so that part actually doesn t bother me too much it s just odd to think that i had a better social life in school oh well i ve pretty much made peace with being an outsider i can t fit in with real people so i ve stopped trying i actually don t even want people to get close to me now\n",
            "more than i d like to admit i hurts me more though when you feel like you fit in for a short time then something changes and you re back being a part of the back ground that no matter how hard you try to push forward or get out of your comfort zone it doesn t seem to matter\n",
            "yeah i had to cut off friends because i didn t feel like i belong anymore now i m just trying to find where i belong i hope i can find it and i hope you can find that sense of belonging as well\n",
            "i haven t fit in since the 8th grade plus even in my past grades i really didn t fit in\n",
            "i feel the same way the only one i feel 100 percent not judged by is my mom without her who knows where i would be now\n",
            "even with my favorite people and the ones who include me in events and conversations i feel like an outsider it s like an invisible wall preventing a connection\n",
            "i do all the time but when i m in a good mood i realize i actually fit in with just about everyone if i get out of my comfort zone a little\n",
            "that feeling lingers constantly no matter where i m at or who i m with it s always floating around in my head the thought that frightens me the most is that people can say anything yet we never know what they re truly thinking i ve had so many people bully hurt me that it s difficult to find trust the bullying has led me to believe that i m always being laughed at by everyone or made fun of i try to convince myself that i m just delusional but it s difficult when it s happened my whole life the negative thoughts seem to outweigh the positive ones so i m always assuming people are thinking the worst of me when they possibly aren t\n",
            "every where i go i don t have any family except for my mom but it s extremely hard to make friends and i ve never had a positive relationship with coworkers or bosses i just don t fit in i m way too different i ve spent most of my life isolated with depression and anxiety and i just can t shake the feeling that there s either something wrong with this world or just something wrong with me or both\n",
            "i often feel like an alien just watching all these human beings their daily activities while feeling detached and having deep existential crisis unfortunately in reality i am constantly being forced pressured to live in the society in order just to survive everyday note to make money make ends meet it is extremely boring limiting stupid and depressing i have been depressed too for quite a long time and i m afraid it s just only getting worse as i get older i m turning 37 this month and yet i am still a total loser failure in this shitty human s society i also have secretly often thinking or have fantasy about death suicide like maybe it s not a bad thing at all to rather just be dead than being forced pressured everyday to live in this crazy shitty human s society world existence reality\n",
            "i always fit in but i never feel like i belong where i am like a lost puzzle piece that found a spot in a place that it had to manipulate itself to go in\n",
            "yes to everything you said and at the same time i feel lonely sometimes i feel bad that i don t connect like how others do and share stuff then i just feel like i want to be alone and then i feel lonely it s really strange and confusing\n",
            "yep thanks to lots of chronic illness and being born into multiple minority groups that are hated in the us and poverty resulting from all the health issues added on top depression included on the plus side i m living outside of a society i would never want to belong in\n",
            "yup lol i wanna fucking die i ve been pushing any friends i have away cuz i feel like they only there cuz i m pitiful\n",
            "all the time sadly 43 now and can t recall anytime i have ever felt like i belong or fit in anywhere\n",
            "way too often it s an awful nagging bit of depression baggage i wouldn t wish on anyone lurking on here makes me sad that other people have to go through this but it eases the loneliness the sensation is bad enough in a city or party but i ve started feeling recently it with relatives i once felt close to i feel subhuman like i m some other species observing and trying unsuccessfully to blend in when i ask my wife or sister they say i look fine and couldn t notice anything unusual somehow that lack of being seen makes it more painful\n",
            "it s not just a feeling i ve been told i m not welcome in communities spaces i really wanted to be a part of directly and indirectly it really fucking sucks i feel you\n",
            "i do have this feeling alot but with certain people or groups of people i don t feel like that maybe try getting to know people who share stuff with you like some character traits hobbies interests or anything really it s hard to bond with people that expect you to be something that you aren t eg family and friends from school usually\n",
            "you know how movies have extras that don t contribute in any real way they just take up space that s what every year of my life has been\n",
            "absolutely i m 23 and only made friends i really love about two years ago and whenever a meetup is being organized i still want to cancel because i feel i d be somebody whose presence they have to put up with\n",
            "i m used to it felt frustrated at first but when u accept it s the way u live it becomes comfortable\n",
            "yes i feel like my existence is not important to anyone and no one actually cares or would miss me like i could disappear and my family and friends wouldnt even notice that i m gone it s a horrible feeling\n",
            "all the time i feel like this around my family even i recently dropped all my friends except two people whom actually understand me some days i m completely fine with it just being my dog and i other days i yern to have a connection\n",
            "yeah i feel like cousin oliver it sucks i can either be myself and not get along with anyone or pretend to not be myself and get along with everyone if i could i d pretty much write the whole bunch off\n",
            "yup this is why i try not to stay in the same place for more than a few months at a time\n",
            "i used to feel like that too but it stopped after i started accepting and loving myself for exactly the person i am im going to tell you is not an easy and quick road but when you make it its full of peace and joy i dont have to please or act a certain way for someone to like me anymore i m just me and if someone doesnt like me its his choice and its normal not everyone is going to like us just like we dont like certain people for whatever reason when you stop giving fucks for external acceptance your life changes remember this the only validation we need is the one that comes within ourselves\n",
            "i did often when i was younger sometimes i still do but you find as you age where you belong and where you are meant to be i have found that where you belong doesn t really matter feeling like you belong there doesn t really matter what really matters is where you were meant to be whether people want you there or not and where you re going the feeling of belonging is always temporary but always feeling a little bit more at home each time keeps you searching\n",
            "completely agree with you constantly feeling inadequate and not belong anywhere just being alone and minding my own business and people still find ways to put you down\n",
            "i completely relate my friend f always feel like the odd one out in every group disposable and my existence is as uninteresting as my absence and if don t ask abt ppl ppl don t ask abt me\n",
            "always i never feel alright arround people not even my family ifeel like im just and im constantly thinking am i voring ect\n",
            "constantly even with people i ve been frequenting for over a decade who make an effort to be in my life\n",
            "yup take even the nicest person and they won t want to be friends with me don t even have talent looks etc to make me look more appealing the world sees me as a stupid ugly person who isn t worth anything this is why i won t have any children if you don t have anything to offer people don t care just facts\n",
            "yes all the time even my own good friends make me feel like they like each other more than they like me\n",
            "yes i feel this way too i just feel awkward and that i m just overstaying my welcome and that i should just leave i m not wanted nor needed here\n",
            "i am same takes me forever to get to know anyone and after a while i always get screwed over or let down i am too loyal too good of a friend and also blunt not outspoken in fact i have trouble thinking of stuff to say hate to talk on phone but if asked i call it as i see it if you don t want to know don t ask me i can count the number of real connections i ve had with people on my fingers sadly my late husband knew me better than i know myself we were married almost 30 years worked together and never had a real argument i always thought i maintained my own identity but when he died i realized that i hadn t really because you can t do both i thought at first that i would be alright eventually now i know i will never be there was nothing much before him and there s nothing now i go day to day in parallel universe on outside looking in i ve had a couple of dates with perfectly nice guys but there was nothing there older men who ve been single for long time don t show much interest in long term relationships and are sort of like fine if you do and fine if you don t i am lucky to have had what i did real love partnership mutual respect partnership friendship with great love comes great loss and that is just too much to ever get over when he died i died too didn t know at the time but do now this is not living it s existing\n",
            "this is one of my greatest issues i didn t think to relate it to depression but i can see how that makes sense i never expect other people to understand or be on my wavelength of negativity and sarcasm it feels horrible to be so alone\n",
            "never felt like i fit in typing this from a bar where i sit alone just for validation of the fact\n",
            "if you guys can relate to each other so well why is it so hard to find friends irl\n",
            "le me having reasonable expectation on people around but they just keep on doing stupid things or things cannot be comprehended more into life i just assume everyone would do stupid things and do everything they could do to kill me so i just become protective to myself\n",
            "hey bro i used to have a similar mindset although what makes you think you need to fit in somewhere life isn t a puzzle where all the right pieces need to align just be yourself and i believe you ll find people that live you and your purpose in life\n",
            "nope never of the thousands of us in the sub i can say for certainty that not a single other person has experienced this\n",
            "100 longest time i ve spend living in a city country is less than 2yrs in the last year i ve moved house 7 times and country once i feel so homesick but nowhere feels like home\n",
            "the story of my life right there i d be in some good company but i m always feeling left out i ve tried to belong but it never seems to happen i think i ve done all i introvertedly can but i don t have any idea how to anymore\n",
            "i feel this too i still have the motivation to meet people and i have different groups of friends but im still the disposable one last option in each group trying for relationships is even more jarring ive had some dates that seemingly go well but then suddenly after just a day ive been dropped i always feel like i have to put in so much effort just to maintain friends relationships i end up exhausted then shut myself for a while i dont have any solutions ive just been pretending to ignore that lonely feeling but when im alone i keep asking myself whats wrong with me im already 29 i keep hoping ill turn it all around but part of me is just in the dark\n",
            "like you never truly relate to others on an emotional level and to interact socially requires some form of external numbing to act appropriately without a major amount of internal dialogue or social anxiety\n",
            "i dont fit because nobody knows my type or feelings or anything else they see me like an idiot or something but better alone than surrounded by idiots\n",
            "as i m struggling with depression since 2005 when i was just 17 i still don t have a husband family on my own not close to the family members i m freelance designer very few friends tell me about loneliness i think i ran out of breath i m sorry you re going through this big hug i wish you find something someone in life that will make you feel better about your life\n",
            "ever seen the king of the hill episode where bobby is a peer counselor and they have a hugging session but tell bobby to stand over there and him himself that s pretty much how i grew up i tried joining clubs in college even those that claimed to be about exclusivity and acceptance ect not so much image\n",
            "yes at the moment i feel like a complete outsider i also feel extremely abnormal i feel like restricting being myself around people as i m so weird and i ve been let down by people so much i don t trust anyone at the moment and i m constantly laughed at for being myself i feel as though the whole world is laughing at me and i feel like a complete outsider\n",
            "i have felt like this since my childhood it seems like everyone is going about their days with purpose everyone knows what they need to do to get to where they want to be i am constantly in a flux of not understanding why i bother to do any of this when i already feel the weight of it not mattering at all to anyone anywhere i feel like i am a ghost at times waiting for the body to deteriorate so i don t have to pretend that i care about what i do on this planet with the limited time i have it is all the same to me every experience is the same and every emotion the same as well they all come back to the same thing in the end and its tiring to pretend for others so i prefer to stay away from them it is rare to find anyone who understands\n",
            "i often feel this way i find it hard to make friends because of this i ve gotten used to small talk and chit chat even though it doesnt interest me too much but forming real relationships is so difficult for me now i never know where i stand and wondering what others think of me drives me nuts\n",
            "i have that feeling all the time i ve moved schools atleast 6 times and countries twice back and forth each time thinking i m gonna grow up with these people and have memories and shit then spontaneously moving to another school having to forget them and move on everyday i m constantly reminded that i don t belong anywhere and i ll always be an outsider\n",
            "i am feeling like this exactly now i am really envious of my co workers of the people i know of for seeking to be so peaceful of doing so all right with everything of not having this vermin inside their head like i feel i have i feel so different from them and so inferior because of that i feel like even when things get better they eventually go down again i am tired of that\n",
            "i too feel this i cope with it by stepping in to my extrovert people have no idea i m depresso majoris\n",
            "yeah and then once i find someone i click with my instinct is to hover so instead of being the needy friend i isolate myself a lot\n",
            "all the time except when i m with super close friends of mine the worst thing though is feeling both like a misfit and inferior when around other people\n",
            "yes it s to such an extent that even though i have an office space i work from home i used to sit in the office for 2 years but it just makes me feel lonelier n at home i find peace\n",
            "yes then when it comes to others looking lonely like being left out of conversations i do my best to pull them back in as quickly as fucking possible and leave myself out being lonely doesn t end up being that bad after you get used to it but it still hurts\n",
            "before you diagnose yourself with low self esteem make sure you re not surrounded by assholes paraphrased quote by sigmund freud i thought i didn t fit then i found nice people\n",
            "me even though i feel comfortable with my connections just that there is this feeling of emptiness that flows through me when i look at them i feel i don t belong here n proceed to think about it until class is over\n",
            "i can assure you everyone has that feeling luckily arguably start to meditate enough and you might find this is a veil that s worth breaking for most their brains keep them occupied so if you don t have that going for you it can be tough i can guarantee you a few things some of these are borderline motivational cliches but they are for a reason right everyone you meet is dealing with shit you could not imagine noone knows precisely you it s literally impossible every single person comes in contact with every other single person from a different perspective there are as many versions of you as there are people you have come into contact with you can t know someone else precisley this goes for jesus elvis hitler tom brady your mom your best friend and your worst enemy every communication we make is assumption city only hurt people hurt people anytime anyone has ever dismissed you or been a dick there s a problem or fear in them that s caused that i don t think this needs to be acted on then you are doing what they are doing just kept in mind i m not sure what truth i m trying to give you here and i could probably narrow this down a bit but i find it comforting that no one has a clue what the fuck they are doing even if they look like they do and that s ok peace\n",
            "yes once in awhile i ll be doing better and not feel that way for a bit then it will crash back while i m with people who care about me or at least are nice and the crashing makes me feel that much worse about being there and then i feel guilty for ever spending a moment thinking i could fit in even tho that s not healthy and probably not true it s one of the symptoms of depression it doesn t mean you actually don t fit in or don t belong just that you feel that way which still sucks but it isn t true i find i do better when i can remind myself it s just a feeling and it s probably not true statistically speaking there will be some places we don t fit in but there also have to be some where we do i also like doing theatre when i get like this the auditioning is stressful triggering af but some community theatres let everyone in and then practice makes progress with community theatre just being there is enough to qualify as belonging logically even if it s not how i feel and then i don t have to worry about acting awkward because there are explicit instructions on how i should act and it s not as myself if you ever have the slightest inclination to try it i highly recommend it probably not as a main character tho lol unless you change your mind about the spotlight or are curious what it s like to be in the spotlight as another person\n",
            "yes literally as long as i can remember i ve had phases where i had close friends and felt understood like the last half of my senior year in college one year in high school where i ended up at a podunk redneck school but found a tight group of weirdos and ended up best friends with them a couple of years after i got out of college and ended up with 3 great friends for a year or two but for the last 11 years since i left my college town it s just been me rolling solo trying to stay in touch with old friends and eventually having them disappear occasionally having a best friend girlfriend etc it s fucking lonely right now i m on the verge of deciding to just say fuck it and decide to be alone and stop trying and just focus on my hobbies and passions and travel and career and my rad dog and be a happy solo human\n",
            "i always feel that way it is as if i were just watching a play that i occasionally get to interact with\n",
            "so i enjoy things that non of my let s call them peers just because we re around the same age enjoy i don t enjoy things that they enjoy i m the black sheep of the family like the extended family especially in my little family mom and dad are let s just say better off than many people not all people but many people sister is also a bit of a genius i look like a pile of fat shit i talk like a pile of turd i inherited everything that is bad from mu ancestors and the had a few on my own while having none of their better qualities so yes i feel not belong all the time but i m okay with that if my sufferings mean that my family is better off if my lack of goodness means that other members of my family have more of the better qualities then i m fine with it\n",
            "yes i enjoy fewer peoples company less and less there s almost nobody i want to expend the effort to talk to anymore\n",
            "i just wanted to search for a post like this and it came up my phone is a mind reader so yes i feel like everyone is getting along and i m invisible\n",
            "yep i think thats why literally my biggest fear and my biggest trigger is being forgotten because my entire life i ve just felt overlooked and really thought i d die alone and forgotten it s gotten better now that i m married and have a daughter but sometimes they even feel like strangers to me\n",
            "i feel in the same way but i m happy to no fit with others because i don t want to be like them i m so happy talking with myself and sometimes i can share a little with my husband but not everything that is in my mind\n",
            "i feel this most days i feel like a background character that s insignificant in the lives of others\n",
            "i think this is honestly just a common symptom of depression when your in a shitty mood and not really up for things it s obvious you wont want to be very social or outgoing not that anything is wrong with you or that you cant relate to anybody your just letting your depression keep you alone practice self care go to the gym eat clean amd read or listen to positive intriguing topics and dont forget tell yourself everyday that im a not my depression\n",
            "a lot of times i m longing for a person who can understand my words from science to the music books and almost everything i lost the arguments to myself whether i m overfitting to somewhere to i don t deserve to be here that s the most depressing thought about it\n",
            "i feel alone and i am alone i tried several times making friends but it never works people never care i really wanted to talk socialize but sadly nobody cares i have no choice but to adapt to loneliness else i won t be happy\n",
            "i have a speech problem and it s made me really fucking depressed i ve started really paying attention to conversations and i ve noticed that whenever i try to say something i always get interrupted or talked over no exceptions feels like nobody wants me around\n",
            "i literally feel like this because i ve never lived in a place or with people for longer than like 3 years i m always moving around just along for life s ride but i have to remind myself that no matter where i am or who i m with i am loved\n",
            "yes i ve had this feeling since i was in elementary basically as far back as i can remember it used to make me feel very sad and depressed like nobody loved me that i was unintelligent that i didn t belong anywhere my self esteem self confidence and self worth were always very low it made romantic relationships very hard to maintain i would end up acting out in very self destructive behavior i m an introvert and anti social as the result of all of this but now that i m 36 and much wiser with lots of life experience i ve realised that i was perfectly fine all along i m grateful for having felt that way and that i still do to this day i m not the crazy one the world is and all those people who fit in i d rather not be a part of the madness ignorance is bliss but i m glad i see things for the way they truly are\n",
            "struggling with this currently meeting with friends feels like visiting strangers i hardly talk with them and just sit there usually listening to their banter that most of the time doesn t interest me or browse stuff on my smartphone i recently took a break from them to rethink some things any new people nada same shit we talk about some common ground but we run out of topics quickly it gets to the point i don t even want to talk to them out of fear that i m bothering them\n",
            "first of all i just want to say i have not been diagnosed with depression though i have been in and out of therapy had medicine and such also apologise for the long text i tend to do this i feel the same i am both autistic and have adhd so that might have something to do with it but i switch between needing my own space and not wanting anyone within 50m 164ft and needing someone even just sitting near me to feel safe or something i also feel super bad about constantly needing my boyfriend to be next to me or at least available at all times because he is the only one helping me atm even though my boyfriend and everyone in his family are the nicest human beings i have ever met especially compared to my parents and how they treated me whilst growing up i just feel in the way and annoying especially and specifically because of my autism because that gives me needs bf constantly tells me his entire family loves me but i just can t accept it i actually just broke down crying because i feel like bf is taking way too good care of me because i am so used to be treated badly he left me recently to go make me some tea to cheer me up and some surprise or something he likes to give me small surprises i both want to be in the spotlight and the shadows at the same time kind of i want to be taken care of and get better yet i prefer to half be alone and take care of myself and i just feel like a mixed up bloody mess many times i suddenly in some situations especially having to do with human interaction just feel like and want to lie down wherever i am and break down crying my heart out only problem is being in public or that i am around other people in general and it wouldn t be accepted really since i am 19 and getting closer to 20 and my parents has been strict since young age about behaviour which is also why when i am actually alone and can cry am unable to cry well i will stop wasting possible readers time and wish you all a great morning day evening and hope for you all to be at least okay take care of yourselves and each other\n",

            "i feel exactly the way you do i ve been in that situation all my life and i feel like there is no escape people say its because i don t try hard enough and that kills me so much because it s not true i truly hope you find a someone or a group of people to make you feel wanted and that you belong there\n",

            "yeah and it s weird because i have one close friend and we have a small group so it feels weird and selfish to say i feel like i don t belong but i think it just come from just being disconnected from myself and everything in general\n",
            "always even when i know i do and i am with my people i still feel like i m a different type of person that no one understands i feel i have this secret life with my depression even though friends know about it it s still my secret sometimes i like that and sometimes i hate it\n",
            "i have always felt like ever since i was little i find it hard to make friends and even with my closet of friends there are times when i feel like an outsider and i don t know if you can relate to this op but the thing that makes me feel like an outsider the most is how people always reach out to others to hang out or introduce themselves i feel like whenever i am out in public no one wants to talk to me or even look at me it s the worst feeling for me personally\n",
            "yeah i feel like this never been able to put it into words before thank you\n",
            "i do i never fit in even tho it seems like ppl like me but it s mostly to the way i work and the stuff i do for ppl so i dont have any friends only co workers and acquaintances as far as family i tried to talk to them and explain how i feel but was told i ll get over it i spend most of my off time alone doing stuff to keep my mind of the fact that i ll probably be this way for the rest of my life i dont talk alot and i stay to myself so the obvious is that i haven t had a personal relationship in years i can tell no one wants to deal with a mental case like my self and i have came to terms with that well thank you all for at least letting me get this off my chest\n",
            "always i feel like it s because we are all mixed with even more experiences than before for example because travel was less common and different from one another now in this generation with different opinions because knowledge is now accessible more than ever so although we are all more connected through social media and other forms of technology because of extra exposure we are all really more different because of it\n",
            "i feel this way everyday it became more apparent as i got into my mid 20s and realized i was totally lost i feel like i don t have a connection with anyone and even with some of my friends who i ve known for years i now feel disconnected and awake are with i feel that i never have anything to talk about the other day i realized i m a loner who never wanted to be one\n",

            "there are times i have sought to isolate myself out of a feeling that i m not good for other people s wellbeing the antidote to this was found in humility how am i supposed to know if i m a potentially negative agent in the lives of others its strange how depression can come with its own perverted arrogance i find a little humor in watching myself thinking unhealthy\n",
            "i know this exact feeling however i ve started looking at it like this what have i got to lose to try and have a good time i m not hurting anybody i m 32 now and i look back say over the last 10 years and realize how quickly it just passed me i don t want do wake up at 42 and have the same feeling life is so short my friend\n",
            "we normally don t wake up excited the biggest issue is that we start to forget the last time we were legitimately happy and then all the days blend together and memories are missing\n",
            "my lady told me once that as soon as i would wake up everyday i would say fuuuuuck under my breath i didn t even realize or know i was doing it feeling this way the second your eyes open is a horrible way to start the day i hope it gets better for you\n",

            "before i even opened my eyes this morning the first thought in my conscious mind was yes i think maybe suicide is best today i have not felt this way in many years i will never do it but that doesn t take away from how miserable i feel four hours later and i m still just lying in bed unmotivated and defeated\n",
            "i wake up and it s like the whole day is already gone and then i realize i ve spent the entire time sitting doing nothing thinking i guess smoking weed distracting myself more like trying not to think honestly i do it to myself though y know i m more than this but i feel like sometimes i just don t try hard enough it s not that i don t want to i just feel like weak or something but i have so much potential\n",
            "i wake up and instantly try to put my self back to sleep with meditations on youtube to calm my mind at my worst i was sleeping anywhere from 18 20 hours a day\n",
            "better stay in bed four more hours in hopes that ll make it easier to get out of it eventually and then feel bad for wasting so much of your day only even of what s left of the day you can muster at most about two hours of light productivity before calling it a day and telling yourself you ll do better tomorrow you just have to get back into the groove if i just go to bed at the right time so that i can t help but to get up early tomorrow then it ll be all easier but you haven t been in the groove now for longer than you can remember when nothing within your grasp makes you feel good anymore downtime just becomes desperately milking distractions for what little cheer up potential they hold all the while lying to yourself you ll just need another hour or just this evening or just till tomorrow and then you ll get back to it again but of course you always end up too exhausted from all the rumination and never being at peace beyond that sleep s sweet oblivion becomes such a comforting hiding spot i ve been trying to turn shit around for years now and i gotta tell you it s an excruciatingly slow process and i ll probably never get to where i think i ought to be\n",

            "we deserve to enjoy the days i relate 1000 to what you re saying i ve made it a priority this year to try and pump myself up with positivity in the morning works about 2 of the time lol and i guess it s more a gentle morning song than pumping myself up like look how nice your bed is isn t it nice look at the sun thank you sun for shining etc you get the idea but now i can feel the gratitude sincerely at least more than ever before it s weird how resistant my personality can be to joy but i ve gotten a little better take care friend lots of people have beaten this we can too\n",
            "i remember a few years back i would lie down at night and i would groan and say oh fuck oh fuck and in the morning i would wake up and say oh fuck oh fuck my life wasnt worth living and still isnt 3 4 years later but everyday now i fight it and try to improve things everyday its almost impossible to make things change its like the worlds default is to keep u down in the mud\n",

            "i wake up dreading every single day that i have to go through i usually wake up with this uncomfortable empty feeling in my heart stomach life has been feeling like an absolute drag\n",
            "so true but recently a change occurred in me that i believe shook me out of that routine even if temporarily i think i usually have a default level of sadness at all times but recently my husband have been through some troubles due to misunderstandings and now every morning i wake up and i feel like i need to make him feel loved and important because he seemed like he had lost confidence in himself the fact that this helps him and that also distracts myself feels quite amazing to me i m in some sort of distracted mode and besides helping him out i have the energy to clean our apartment and do other chores not much pertinent with the post but i just wanted to share maybe it can help someone else too\n",

            "happens whenever i catch a glimpse of normality a moment of clarity basically whenever i realize i need to change this fundamental thing about who i am or the other i get really down i don t know why i m so resistant to change i ve heard it described as the feeling your brain gets when it knows it has to kill your current self to make way for the new i get existential about it because i then think of all the time i ve spent like this and wonder why it had to be me there s a positive spin to that for sure but idk it still feels uncomfortable and depressing\n",

            "yes i think it s just the depression reminding me that it s still there i feel like there must be some environmental triggers that i m not mindfully aware of but my brain is aware of everything and responds to the trigger on a subconscious level\n",
            "i woke up today knowing i was on the brink of depression i know myself entirely too well in order to not know what s happening i m consciously acknowledging this and making the conscious effort to not let that get me i just reached out to a friend that has a genuine connection with me and we re gonna hang out good luck\n",

            "never related to something so much in my life recently l happened to stare at the mirror longer than usual then i automatically just pointed at my reflection and blurted out you s a vain little bitch which kinda made me laugh bc normally people be sayin damnnn i look finee and then there s this time where we re in an amusement park basically having a pretty good time then midway through a viking ride i suddenly spaced out mid air like all the fun and thrill and screaming never happened it was fun while it lasted though\n",

            "yeah usually happens when i go take a piss actually probably because there s nothing distracting my mind also when i m trying to fall asleep and in the shower i find myself cussing aloud when the thoughts enter my head and then usually feel embarrassed that i just did that\n",
            "all the time usually in the middle of class or the dining hall or a party and i want to go to my room and die but i don t have the energy to move\n",
            "i know that feeling i have them as well just not as often as i do with the knives\n",

            "i always tried to make myself busy otherwise the self hatred starts sinking in and i m literally useless don t get me wrong it s always there just dripping inside my mind but manageable when it s suddenly pouring down is when i m really scared\n",
            "yep really i think almost everything i do is laced into that feeling the only relief is knowing i did something anyway\n",
            "i feel like this a lot of the time but do you ever question whether your feelings are real or if you re just feeling sorry for yourself i feel this all the time and think maybe i m overreacting and i m always questioning whether i actually hate myself and if i m actually depressed or maybe i just can t deal with the situation at hand this probably doesn t make sense like i ll be in a state of hating myself and feeling like nothing will get better and then i go on with whatever i m doing and i think to myself that maybe it wasn t real what i was feeling that is i m just curious if anyone else feels this way ever because i feel very disconnected i mean i m not always miserable so it makes it hard to believe i guess but when the feeling sets in it really sets in but then i feel like maybe it was self induced and i made myself upset so then it s not legit i could ramble on about it forever i m confused again probably doesn t make any sense\n",
            "i wake up in the middle of the night and just burst into tears because i have to face another day with depression i try to hard to reach out to people and form relationships but everything is so surface level no one ever wants to talk about this shit with me no matter how many times i ve talked to them about their problems before when you re honest with people and say hey i m depressed today you just alienate yourself more with school i feel like i can never be good enough no matter how much i try and then it passes and i feel like i can do anything and then it always fucking comes back i m so fucking tired of feeling alone\n",
            "i have it too sometimes some days i feel depressed and feel like i m going nowhere in life but then i try to be positive\n",
            "i woke up the other night so my brain could yell at me hey remember death is a thing you are going to die one and as is everyone else ever fuck off brain not now\n",
            "all the time i was doing a math test and then i just stopped the whole class i was just staring at my paper not doing anything\n",

            "this is what can make it hard to speak to friends about my problems i feel like they might not understand why i feel so bad i guess i was once like them too or i just did a better job of ignoring the depression\n",
            "this honestly boggles my mind sometimes for the longest time i didnt think people were that happy with their lives but i soon learned that people didnt understand how someone could be depressed and are actually excited for their lives i dont think ive ever been excited for my life or happy for a long period of time its always just been so gloomy\n",
            "i recently found out there s people who never had any suicidal thoughts or even an i wish i wasn t born thought ever i have no clue how that would feel how can you live so long and never feel like that after 11 years of fighting suicidal thoughts and surviving several attempts i don t have active suicidal thoughts anymore but i still hate myself for not pushing through i don t want to kill myself but i don t want to live anyone get that if i could travel back in time i would push myself\n",
            "this is so true and for me adhd as well i see it a lot more tho in life cause everyone is like work hard and your dreams will come true but its sometimes impossible for me sit down and actually do any kind of work at all then mix that with the fact that adhd lowers ur dopamine and i literally just feel like meh whatever or im crying its weird to think some people can do a lot of work and not feel like theyre being tortured and then feeling happy about it after\n",

            "there s been a handful of times in my life where my depression lifted enough that i felt arguably normal and each time i thought holy shit this is amazing normal people have no idea how good they have it\n",
            "these are people who didn t face aversion in childhood and thus didn t sustain any trauma for them to develop a bitterness and fear of the surrounding world and society we live in they were able to assimilate into their peer groups and received adequate amount of love and support from their core family as well as extended family they aren t generally super high in empathy which makes it easier for them to disregard the suffering of others from professor sapolsky s lecture on depression depression is caused exacerbated by no social support lack of control loss of love lack of outlets for the anger and sorrow no predictability\n",
            "i think that a lot of people correlate their optimistic attitude with a lack of depression but that s fundamentally wrong i think you can be a positive person and still get depression edit i m mostly referring to the respondents on the other post who mention optimism as their reason for not having depression\n",
            "i think about this a lot i m severely depressed along with a slew of other mental and physical health issues and my brother is normal he s got zero mental health issues zero trauma he s not overly sensitive like i am he s doing fantastic in life and im just drowning i think that s great for him i just wonder what went so wrong for me\n",
            "these are people i truly envy like damn imagine not having a second of your life be consumed by your crippling mental illness imagine not hindering your social life and hurting your loved ones imagine not being constantly consumed by guilt despair self pity and self hatred imagine living on earth and not be constantly aware of the negative aspects that surround yourself imagine having healthy coping mechanisms and problem solving skills imagine living life happily and not be thinking about ways to kill yourself fucking wild concept man\n",
            "i think about this constantly i still can t fully grasp what it would be like to not have any type of mental illness or trauma how do those people live their lives obviously like most people would live but like what is their life like that makes it so that they are just so mentally stable i guess is the word\n",
            "i feel blessed to not live in poverty or raised in a horrid household there has been problems in my life like anyone reading this but i don t know how i would have and can hold on to life with more hardships edit post cursor not saying poverty makes someone depressed or mentally ill but with a disposition like that i could only assume how soul crushing it must be\n",
            "cross post i constantly wonder about this i wonder what goes through a non depressed person s mind do they have any negative self talk do they need to check in with themselves and ask themselves why they re in a bad mood is everyday a struggle to just try and get your shit together\n",
            "there was this one annoying kid in my highschool band he didn t have depression i used to call him happy bastard good times\n",
            "this is why i m glad to an extent that i have close friends who are depressed as well obviously it s horrible and i wish i could cure all of us but at the same time it makes it way easier for us to talk about it knowing that we feel the same\n",
            "i think about this every single fucking day i used to think that people were just blissfully ignorant and life was just not depressing to them because they had no fucking idea what was going on around them i genuinely cannot imagine anyone not being depressed in this climate i feel you 100000000 i have met people who aren t depressed and i can t really click with them i seem to only click with people who have been through a ton of trauma i don t even know if i want to be like those people despite hating my depression\n",
            "i feel very similarly like i ve literally never been in a position in my life that i can remember where i could just wake up and not feel soul crushing dread about my future and think about all my insecurities and just generally feel like the world was working against my favor my mom isn t depressed and she just seems so joyous optimism and ready to be a part of the world but i m just like i d rather be in my room crying than go out somewhere because it just feels like there s no point in doing anything if we all end up dead\n",
            "i use to be like that way back in middle school but then slowly i would get more and more depressed\n",
            "i often hear comments from co workers that they just can t understand why anyone would try to kill themselves about a month ago there were two suicides in the hessian ministery of finance so many people talked about it in germany i just didn t know how to respond since i exactly knew why someone would try it i ve never attempted suicude but i ve had thought about it basically since teenage years so i just shrugged it off i wouldn t want them to know i ve been struggeling with these thoughts my whole adult life the concept that people don t get why people kill themselves however is just alien to me\n",
            "i used to be in the exact same boat as you but i ve finally tackled my issues and i can understand what it s like to wake up and not want to die keep making efforts to help your mental health it s worth it\n",

            "i ve beaten mine two years of going up the hill then falling down then long hours of personal and group therapy and dozen of re thinking and reinventing at the lowest point i found myself aimlessly staring at the wall thinking about becoming a monk at the monastery to give my life at least some meaning but now it s all gone my memory is back brain fog is gone things in my life are still not perfect and i still got a lot to do but it got much better overall i had to accept some bitter facts like inability to build healthy relationships and some unpleasant traits of my personality but now i can think of positive future again now more realistic amount of books unread movies unwatched places unexplored amazes me again that s how it feels and i believe every depressed person can achieve that\n",
            "this is a thought that s plagued me for as long as i can remember having memories i can vividly recall almost daily when i was a kid diligently observing my peers and the others around me desperately trying to wrap my head around how they seemed to be able to go through life so easy or carefree or effortlessly yet i couldn t it s plagued me my entire life spent trying to figure out wtf was wrong with me what was i doing so differently i still don t really understand to this day but becoming jaded bitter has at least made it so that i don t give a fuck anymore at least\n",
            "when i have conversations with my parents about my depression they seem to think there s a fix i haven t found yet a way to be the normal people you speak of but you can t just go from hating every waking moment to true happiness i feel like there s a point where people are too far gone to ever experience any sort of normal i think i m stuck like this for life\n",
            "i have sad which means i live both the depressed and normal life i still feel the same as you i feel like i have two personalities inside me the things i do during the first half of the year i would never do or think of doing during the second half it is mind blowing it makes me sad and angry at depression it is an awful thing to have i wish people would put more emphasis in curing it\n",
            "i don t know i m kinda the opposite of this for the longest time i thought i was the only person in the world that felt depression i thought other people were happy and normal imagine my surprise when i found out there are other people in the world just as miserable as me\n",
            "i think that is why i like this sub so much people are either depressed somehow or very understanding of people being depressed makes me feel like a normal people to certain extend\n",
            "same i sometimes bring up depression assuming the person i am talking to understands then i catch myself when they seem uncomfortable and realize not everyone has it or understands the concept of it i ve had it so long that i don t even remember it isn t necessarily normal\n",
            "it s always been hard to relate to the people around me they seem to happily wake up and just go about their day no negative thoughts no sapped mental strength no constant stream of not wanting to exist it would be nice to be blessed with this at least once in my life\n",
            "there are obviously many factors but a lot of the normal people i know all come from healthy happy stable families can t relate\n",

            "yeah tbh it s mind boggling to me sometimes i think about that and i really can t even picture it the mindset makes no sense to me i wish it did it s so odd to have a similar scenario as someone and not have your mind jump to the same conclusions or think of the same things so weird\n",
            "there are thought oriented people and action oriented people we who are prone to depression think too much and do little some people keep doing things and hardly think anything and then there are people who think of the problems decide what they can do about it and do it i envy the third type of people and try to be like them sometimes i achieve success and many times i fall short of it i keep trying though\n",

            "i know people like this my best explanation if a person who copes with depression and a person who doesn t wanted to try to understand each other as an individual with chronic depression i imagine the other side of the fence are like the days we have that sometimes break up the consistent bad days you know the ones i mean you wake up in a pleasant way having actually slept well the night before it s beautiful outside you don t have work class or any other obligations for the day you decide the beauty of the day and your good mood should be spent doing something that you enjoy on your own for me that s when i take my old dslr d40 out put my headphones on one ear piece on the other clipped over my shirt collar and plugged into my phone i ll go for a walk through my neighborhood looking for things beautiful interesting or that catches my eye or maybe i ll go for a drive first go to some of my favorite places the woods i grew up traversing by the lake with the old camp cabins still stand there s an open field between two areas of woods and trails i ve occasionally had beautiful moments with curious animals though not nearly as much as i wish i head off again to snap photos of my favorite restaurant fronts unique bits of the original buildings from the town s founding still intact i might do any number of things next maybe i ll treat myself an ice cream cone or i may decide i want to make a few batches of cookies for no other reason than to make the house smell of vanilla extract and cookie dough i might decide it s a perfect day to sit outside and read just to still enjoy the sunshine i might take my dog out for a walk though admittedly that s for both of us i may even play a little pokemongo while we re out i might end it with anything from taking my camp chair from the garage looking up at the stars that i can see so clearly from the backyard a hot bath or maybe a cool shower then play with my cat for a while before we are both ready to settle in whether i return to my book decide to watch something on whichever streaming service while working on a puzzle book or coloring in one of my many adult coloring books none of the photos from the day will be for social media or even to share proudly with friends they re pieces of my life and they re images from a day i felt content maybe even happy they re just for me to look back on and remember a day when i was happy by myself doing something i love and doing it just for me now to my actual point i m not suggesting that i think those lucky enough to be well adjusted emotionally stable people spend every day like that obviously that s absurd what i do think is that the content relaxed feeling we get when as a day like that winds down that feeling we want so much to hold onto and take with us from sleep to awakening again i think that is what for lack of a better term normal is i also think those folks have far more days like that regularly only they don t have to hold on tight when they go to sleep because that content feeling is just their standard setting they absolutely have experiences with temporary depression it s the depression of going through the grief process of someone we love especially when the loss is someone we were extremely close with parents siblings children friends pets or s o s i believe very firmly that when it comes to grief we are all the same i do not believe nor have i ever felt that because i struggle with depression that my grief is more intense or harder to cope with than for a non depressed person i very much believe do believe that grief while different as individuals going through different losses we grieve the same we feel the same intense misery sometimes just the numbness and the feeling of being at a loss of what to do how to cope etc if i was trying to explain to an nd what living with depression is like i would say first that not every day do we feel the full intensity of pain and sadness like that we all experience with loss it is not a full overwhelming struggle every second of every day on a permanent loop it s more like spending our days in various stages much like grief there are days when we absolutely feel that despair and misery overwhelmingly other days it can be more regular day we may not feel completely encompassed by a sense of dread but the possibility of that is never far plus there are a vast array of other areas of depression and there isn t always a specific reason for some no triggers hopefully that gives us all a window into each other a bit\n",
            "slightly off topic but a smiliar thing when prescribed anti anxiety medication for a while after it kicked in i couldn t believe the general chill i felt about things and how the cycle of worry would start and then just dissapate how easy the sleep came how unexpected social situations came up and were enjoyable it genuinely upset me that this is how normal people feel about things wanted to feel that way forever\n",
            "so i ve been on both sides of the coin i was diagnosed with depression at 7 and been on and off medicine since then i m almost 20 now i ve gone through suicidal thoughts mild self harm and 3 therapists not wanting to get up and just feeling empty and worthless since a few months ago for some reason it s like my depression went down i feel pretty happy i m currently on no medication and haven t seen my therapist due to lockdown i remember thinking for years i wouldn t be in the mental state i am now but here we are i still feel weird sometimes have fall downs and tend to be negative but overall i can say i m pretty content with my life still don t have many friends cut down a few doing pretty bad in college living with a psychologically abusive person and feeling alone tho i don t know what advise to give as everyone s situation is different but being ok is possible hang on\n",
            "i always compare myself to my bro and sis we all grew up the same etc them 2 are so normal married kids career what happened to me why am i like this those 2 took the route of religion i am so jealous of their delusional blissfulness i would kill to just accept that belief and be happy in life even if it s not real but i gotta say they put in the effort they go every sunday and get involved\n",
            "for the longest time i thought all people were sad as i am realized i was just projecting\n",
            "depression is completely opposite from the normal survival instinct that s why normal people don t understand it\n",
            "i find that depressed people tend to be more empthatic towards other people and how shitty the world is in general they not only overthink things about themself but overthink about just everything because theyre super empathetic the people that ive talked to that dont have depression dont ever think about that stuff constantly it may seem kinda mean but they are very like shallow minded idk they dont think about things or linger on things for long like theyre more prone to do things say things for the sake of themselves and not care about how they affect others if theres a problem they just either try to fix and if they cant fix it they forget about it like i was talking to 2 people and we were talking about concerns of how future generations are gonna be affected by social media the internet 1 person totally was on the same wave legnth as me and we were like lowkey depressed about it and the other person you could tell that it was something that never crossed his mind ever and he had the mentality of like you cant do anything about it so just forget it which is something i cant understand i honestly still dont get how there s people that arent depressed but thats the only insight i have to understanding these bizarre creatures\n",
            "so i ve in the past few years looked at it like this someone who has no issues with anxiety or depression have no basis for comparison probably why so many are easy to dismiss it the way they do so i m guessing someone depressed has their baseline and may be in the same boat\n",
            "jeez man oh my gosh i don t know what i was expecting with this subreddit but this definitely wasn t it i m one of those people kinda that s happy for the future at least some of it i didn t think that there would be someone who was so confused about not depressed people existing\n",
            "well people who say they dont understand why people are unhappy for no reason are just stupid tbh but whatever i have and i always had this mindset that i always see positive things even in the biggest mess i hope for everyone that they can be happy one day and that they will never regret their life i dont know if it makes sense to post this but i felt like i needed to say this\n",
            "long story short i remember not being depressed and anxious when i was like 11 12 yo now i m 20 and last 5 years feels like black sad and repetitive hole in my head i m not encouraging anyone to do what i did doctor said my brain mainly lacks serotonin 2 years ago easily said so recently i gave my brain a gift sniffed some speed because of serotonin and that one day since couple of years i was free from depression or anxiety it was like being normal again motivation from nowhere open for new people like as a kid i m a smart guy i know much bout things i try really so yeah it somehow showed me how it is not to be depressed and anxious again just like pot did just before i got informed bout depression and no i m not a drug junkie now apparently remembering days like those ones give me strength to keep going it s weird but all true\n",
            "you just get tired mate i got sick of not allowing myself to enjoy life cuz there s no meaning to it so what if there s no meaning who gives a fuck smoke a joint make some food drop some acid chill out n let the days be filled with whatever makes you happy\n",
            "thats what drugs are for 60 of happy people are happy because of drugs im part of that 60\n",
            "life have different meanings based on different perceptions and perspectives personally i see the whole existence a tragedy maybe it s the tragedy our ideas have caused i understand you\n",
            "just as happiness is a foreign concept to us depression is a foreign concept to them when i say foreign concept i mean that it is something either side cannot comprehend\n",
            "i ve had depression from a young age and it s like it s become who i am whereas other people have an actual personality i m trying to change it\n",
            "it s just a brainstate can be switched on almost instantaneously i ve experienced it don t know how to control it though\n",
            "long time depressive here i have given up on other people fully given up my family were the ones that actually hurt to cut but now i m on my own it s what i wanted i kind of have happy days now some days i get up and i go out on my bike and it s actually enjoyable some days can be bad but my medication will always be there for me at night to get to sleep is my life amazing hell no but do i allow the ignorance of other people to make it any worse fuck no even if you change 1 person they probably have 2 or more siblings who are just as stupid those people would have had me dead twice already i don t feel much for anyone who has ever put me in that mindset no real point to this post but you can forge a life in this world where you have little to no contact with anyone i live nearly alone i have one neighbour who mind s his own business like me and it s obvious he doesn t want to speak to me in the same respectful way as i do him we have spoken once and it was clear we wanted to mutually ignore each other lol i guess as people go we have some sort of agreement going on it took me years to find this place it s not expensive but it was hard to find i just kept looking for what i wanted i talk to people online and in game chat and i give advice on some other groups etc this is enough contact for me i don t feel entirely alone and most importantly i m not around people who are going to make me feel like shit just by talking normie drivel\n",
            "blissful and ignorant is a better way to describe these people instead of happy the world is a shit place not worth living in the fact that they re happy just shows how much they don t want to know and or see they dont look at the world at face value but rather through this lense of i have all these things and family and friends and its quite surprising how much they don t care about it\n",
            "i ve had a shit life i m pretty much depressed 24 365 people are like why do you feel like that and i m like i wish i was a dumb as you ignorance is bliss\n",
            "i just think of them not needing the extra boost of a good anti depressant i marvel at them for sure but know with the right mix of medications and therapy it s possible for a lot of us too\n",
            "staying mad or disgruntled at how the world is for those happy people isn t going to fix anything i ve realized the pain and the traumas that i have faced shaped me into the person i am today for the better the streets of la for me is a dark place to say the least stop comparing your experiences to others because everyone has a different perspective and some minds are shaped differently\n",
            "hmm for me its kinda weird i think having a nihilistic mindset keeps me from being really depressed like i would be depressed if i thought things mattered or something\n",
            "ha my roommate who is very depressed says the same thing but i do get it now when i went into my depression hole i would look around and be so mad that people are just happy\n",
            "i get that i purposefully avoid people like that coz i feel i ll never be able to relate to them lol but ultimately i guess i m just jealous i wanna know what that feels like\n",
            "i always thought people couldn t get better but here i am better than i have ever felt in my life this was a long ass journey i did it all by myself with no professional help was diagnosed with severe depression never went through with the prescription or therapy not because i didn t want help on the contrary it could ve made my journey more easier and faster but i am feeling good believe that you re efforts will pay off as long as you don t give up i never in a million years would ve think i would be here not crying every night to sleep or having always low self esteem no confidence always anxious and in a dark place all the time not anymore and it feel like i finally can take a break\n",
            "i ve been on both sides of the spectrum and honestly what changed everything was moving countries and doing a full 180 in diet and exercise i feel amazing almost everyday sometimes i m depressed but i can deal with it now the life i have now is the life i built to make me happy\n",
            "i suffer from waves of depression sometimes i won t be depressed for months at a time and then just be hit with it for like half a year it is an amazing feeling being able to wake up feeing great not constantly procrastinating and not having anxiety attacks every day but this in the end makes me more depressed when i am going through an episode because i literally can t get out of bed no matter how much sleep or little sleep i get i just don t want to get out and then i think about how i can i mean do it when i m not having an episode and just feel extra shitty it s crazy to think people can live most of their lives like that happy and ready for the day currently in the middle or maybe end i hope of an episode and god i want to feel that great again it s genuinely like life could hit you head on and you are ready and prepared to accept it and move on it s fan fucking tastic i hope one day we can all experience at least a year of it\n",
            "i think i ve been on both sides but it s hard to tell given my dgaf personality i could have perhaps spent a large chunk of my life suppressing my depression by fooling myself into believing i was happy with my life a lot of my depression now stems from past problems so that could be the case regardless being someone who can bounce back and forth between manic and depressed when i m on a high i still have those thoughts like how was i so depressed it doesn t make sense yet a week later i m not strong enough to shower or eat and i think i don t remember a time when i was happy it s all mind tricks and even knowing you ve been both places it s still hard to recall the feelings once they ve passed\n",
            "i m bipolar and i experience stuff like this one moment i m happy and content with my life and the next i wonder how i ever felt that way then i m back to being happy with my life i don t understand somethings in my life right now\n",
            "i know exactly what you mean i was diagnosed with depression at 12 so it s all i ve known and thinking about living a life where you don t wake up some days and just cry all day without reason\n",
            "it s always baffled me the most when i talk to my friends or roommates i m always wondering if what they say is real feelings or not and then i realize that i m just reading into it too much and they don t have to put the same mask on that i do every day\n",
            "i used to be severely depressed what it took for me to get out of it so to speak is changing my life from the ground up i realized that my ex husband was a huge drain on my mood so i left he didn t support me and my mental health very much gaslighted me a lot and just made me feel like shit about myself when i left and started living on my own things were really hard money wise every day was a struggle but i was rebuilding my life by myself i kept dating people who also made me feel like shit so i stopped growing for a moment but then i met my now fiance and he really helped me grow just by loving me right now i don t have any low days or suicidal thoughts or anything trust me it was really hard to get to the place i m at today but i m so happy i m here i think it s very possible for many people in this sub to get here too by cutting out the draining bullshit in your lives so many times i wondered if i was doing the right thing but i really was you re not to blame for any of this btw sometimes energy vampires are so successful because they do it so steathily\n",
            "i have a friend who s a total moron but is completely happy with seemingly zero emotional issues i guess ignorance really is bliss\n",
            "as an in out in out depressive yeup you re kinda chill with it to a certain extent the big difference between being sad for very real reasons and being sad on top of depression is that the first one feels finite it feels like it ll be over the problem is a problem which means it comes with a solution as opposed to an unbearable crisis whose outfall will drag everything down for the rest of eternity i wish with all my heart that one day you will know the other side i wish you will know it so well you will forget how this one feels i m currently balancing on the fine line between the two so i m not fully on either but once you ve actually felt optimism it s not as easy to discard it as it is if all you know is the darkness i m sorry you re not there yet i really hope you will one day\n",
            "i was like that back in high school never could grasp how someone could be depressed or suicidal it just boggled my mind fast forward 5 years here i am super depressed an now i can t believe there was a time when i wasn t depressed isn t this like so much fun\n",
            "i decided a long time ago that you will never know why another person feels the way they do this thought started with different views stages of depression and as it turns out it really applies to just about any view someone has on anything\n",
            "well they may not be depressed but humans can feel sadness or other type of pain fear not just depression so if you think they re perfect u re wrong they may not say it they may aren t in a bad situacion and feel good but that s not forever so they may just not being currently depressed but they will o were in at list one time of all their lifes they may be just not depressed but sad not sad but not happy either don t think they are right and u wrong you i mean we may see a lot of aspects in life than them and that s awesome and don t forget the fact that we are stroger than them just by being us you know being here existing\n",
            "what really fuels depression is hopelessness so of course it is unbelievable that you can live without it or be cured of it especially if you ve been depressed for a long time\n",
            "i m happy almost every time i wake up it usually lasts until a fall asleep depending on the events of the day i accredit this to a mixture of working out every day having a good job healthy diet having an amazing wife and kids marijuana creative outlets like writing and making music and always maintaining my to do list i used to be depressed every day when i had my first son it really brought down my family and friends a lot not everyone is as lucky as i am to have a supportive family who can hang in there while i figure myself out thank god i made it out\n",
            "i think everyone has the potential to be depressed and live like that some people just manage their mood without thinking about it or have good support systems coping mechanisms in place but then again those same people could be going through the same thing as you but they just hide it really well i wouldn t think about it too much everybody s got demons\n",
            "ssris are helping me so much i m actually happy to wake up every morning like i ve never been before i genuinely enjoy my work it s not hard for me to find the motivation to exercise or engage in self care behaviors anymore and i m grateful for the life i ve built and the financial security i ve attained i m not as far along in terms of my career or educational achievement as i thought i d be by now but meh i don t feel like i m lacking or wanting for anything either i can finally breathe and just appreciate the present moment my family really sucks and that s where my depression stemmed from i m out of contact with them and have been for a while for good reason and i was angry over the feeling of being rejected for a loooong time but fuck em i have so many great friends that i don t feel bitter about missing out on those relationships anymore i m learning to focus on the positives and that way of thinking is really helping me out of the deep hole i d fallen into\n",
            "a shitty diet can cause severe recurring depression too many carbs carbs turn into glucose and raise you insulin level so many things can go wrong because of a shitty diet vitamin d deficiency is almost universal and that will make you depressed there are so many things that you can do to reduce your depression with just an improvement with your diet but none of those things will work if you don t try them\n",
            "how can you exist without being depressed like i don t even feel depressed depression is just my everyday mood everything feels like nothing it s just basic life either you are numb or then u get a breakdown every once in a while but controlling everything with your obsessive behavior and starvation then everything s just fine but apparently people normally have life plans apparently people feel hope and have dreams apparently people feel exited like people are apparently able to make plans for next week get up in the morning and just have something in their life and that feels so absurd how how can you make yourself shower almost daily how can you not tell yourself that you should yeet yourself off the bridge after a minor inconvenience how can you not start panicking and crying when people tell in social media about how they move on with their life s and reaches new milestones but you are just a piece of numbness without anyone caring about you how please tell me how this is an absolute hell\n",
            "coming from a depressed person it s truly astonishing how there s so many people who aren t depressed and just living their lives\n",
            "i used to be depressed and now i m not i used to have a so called healthy standard american diet with high carbs pills and an occasional desert i was so depressed that i tried to kill myself several times this went on for freaking decades from 1966 to about 2015 about 5 years ago i switched to a ketogenic diet and my depression pretty much evaporated i still had some physical problems so i switched to a carnivorous diet about 2 years ago and my mood got even better since i was 72 at the time it was inevitable that i would continue to have some physical issues so i started fasting and doing grounding things got even better again two months ago i started supplementing with vitamin d sunbathing thanks to covid 19 and pretty much everything got much better i have shared this information with depressives before and they pretty much all slammed me and denigrated me and said that i was lying or that their depression was real implying that mine was fake or false or somehow unreal despite the slash marks on my wrists and the history of no social life i am completely cool with most of you slamming me this time around and calling me a liar or being so stupid as to claim that it will only work for me despite the fact that ketogenic people and carnivorous people all say exactly the same thing i am completely unaffected by people who insist upon remaining depressed really if you want to continue being depressed i am ok with that but i do admit that i am not saintly enough to continue being sympathetic with your insistence upon staying in the conventional box and remaining depressed i have told you the truth here the rest is up to you\n",
            "i noticed that my issues while not depression i suffer from anxiety are related to my understanding of how fucked the world around me is the corruption the abuse the racism and hatred and the acceptance of these things from so many people what helped me is the planning of my future so that i can lead the life i want which just so happens to be the van life of traveling around and seeing new things this has relived some of my anxiety because i have a self defined goal and purpose and a reason to stay alive and be healthy could it be possible that the same could help you i know it s hard to do anything when in a state of deep depression but nothing has to be immediate maybe small steps towards your definition of a life worth living and a lot of ignoring other people s opinions on your chosen path might help\n",
            "before i had depression i wasn t able to understand how people can be in depression i wasn t able to comprehend it i had a friend who was in depression i tried to be supportive to her and tried to educate myself but it never clicked with me it never felt like it was a real thing then i had depression in a time where everything in my life was going well and people around me were dumbfounded they just couldn t understand how i could be depressed i had a well paying job which i loved family and friends an easy life but i wanted to die it was so hard to listen to them trying to understand me i was so frustrated when i was talking to those people i hated them now i don t feel like i can connect with a person in a deeper level who hasn t ever been in depression i sometimes selfishly wish that some people should have gone through depression so that they can be a little bit emphatic\n",
            "one of the best books for depression was amy poehler s yes please it s funny but there is this one line that helped me so much the talking and worrying and thinking is not the thing the doing is the thing it s easy to remember and reminds me that my brain and yours loves worrying thinking planning talking catastrophizing you need to interrupt your brain and do something there is no other way clean exercise write play take meds go to therapy all the solutions are doing zero of the solutions are not doing\n",
            "i have this thought every time i m having a conversation hanging out with anyone that isn t as far as i know depressed like i cannot even imagine how it feels to not wake up in agony how can one actually look forward to the future the last person i dated asked me what i look forward to in the future and i scoffed and said something like nothing there s people that are actually excited for the future and he gave me a look then we broke up like a week later lmao\n",

            "i think depression is prevalent though in fact i d say suffering from at least a bout of it is common even if they aren t depressed their future circumstances may result in depression they likely don t perceive their surroundings as a hellhole maybe they don t spend too much time critically analyzing themselves and the world\n",

            "i don t want to be rude or insensitive but as someone who struggles with depression i ve come to realize and embrace the fact that i we are our support system you can t hold these unrealistic expectations of having friends so they can be there for us when we need them because the voices will only use that against you also those voices are your voices we are our own worst critic and if you don t get in the habit of rejecting those voices and replacing them with encouragement and self love then you won t ever get better it s the sad and harsh truth you are faced with i hope you re able to overcome these obstacles because no one deserves to suffer like we do my life isn t perfect and i still struggle but i can say that my efforts were not in vain i am a better healthier person than when i first started seeing therapy everyone has their own views so i only offer my own opinion in hopes of striking a cord with you best wishes sam\n",
            "not having anyone to turn to amplifies everything ten fold if there s any benefit at all to having a mental health illness like depression is that it makes people like us hyper aware and hyper empathetic to others these are obviously leadership skills if you had a group of people in a room and said you have two leaders to choose from the 1st is empathetic wants to see you succeed and will be supportive even when you are at your lowest the 2nd wants you to be happy constantly and fake it to make it i think it s clear that 99 would vote for you like pretty much everyone commenting i totally get it i had a huge group of friends that i stopped talking to because they would always talk crap on me and be passive aggressive with me because i have depression i would reach out and ask for help just to vent just to have someone to talk to they were all childhood friends i was the person who brought everyone together and they betrayed me and for a long time i thought it was my fault if there s one piece of advice i can give you is it is not your fault please don t beat yourself up about this it s not only not your fault but you will find better friends this friend you speak of is obviously immature if he thinks everyone should always be happy and not real there s a saying that goes something like if you can t stand me at my worst you don t deserve to be there at my best fuck em don t waste your energy on these kind of people i have diagnosed ptsd severe social anxiety bi polar and major depression and i m only 23 a lot of my trauma and social anxiety stems from how this group of friends that i trusted treated me when i was depressed to this day i still often think it s my fault and get scared to make new friends or reach out for help i ve been working to get better for 7 8 years and have barely gotten anywhere i don t want this to happen to you please remember you will find better friends and those who do that aren t worth it they re toxic people who were just dragging you down in the first place i still have yet to find friends 8 years later but the only thing that keeps me going is holding onto hope i genuinely hope things get better for you\n",

            "have you tried exercising getting out of bed is iffy most days you re fuckin dreaming it s your responsibility to make the game worth the candle i have very good friends but when the mask slips off it s like i m speaking another language i literally can t communicate the concept to them it s like playing a video game and you really like one of the other characters you can do all you can to better your relationship and support each other but when it comes down to the real deal you can t really talk to them they can t hear the thoughts in our head no matter how loud we think them\n",

            "i get it being friends with a depressed person isn t fun one of the things that has made my social life the hardest the thing that made me feel most like an outsider sometimes was that happy or well adjusted people don t seem to like being around unhappy less well adjusted people it took me a long long time to realize that was why i wasn t connecting with people in other words i actually don t subscribe to the idea that depressed people are bad to hang around i get along better with people who can sympathize and really understand what it s like to feel alone or miserable i cant stand that so many social groups are so fragile as to depend on smiling\n",

            "hey i get it that s why i form better relationships with others with mental illness makes things easier friends are the ones you are supposed to be able to put the mask away around relax the muscles trying to hold your face in a faux smile i d like to say it gets better but mostly you stop giving a shit don t waste your energy on people who exhaust you keep an eye out for the people that charge your batteries not drain them they can be hard to find but it is worth it to have friends that like who you actually are without pretending\n",

            "i get what it is like man sometimes i don t speak to my friends for weeks on end and sometimes i feel them drifting apart but i find it so hard to articulate to them sometimes that when i don t speak to them its not that i don t want to it s more so that i don t want to break the facade of happiness i have built when around them and it breaks my heart that one day i may lose everyone due to this condition i mean i don t have many friends as is and the thought of losing the remainder hurts me deeper than any physical pain sorry i tend to rant when it gets to this time of night\n",

            "yeah it s not always fun to be with wether platonically or romantically a depressed and or anxious person it can be really hard painful even but also very rewarding when you can make them smile another one i often hear is no one will love you untill you love yourself and telling people to work on themselves before they engage in any relationship but therapy is not the solution for everyone it can make things worse for some for me too and people forget that loneliness is a common cause of depression if not the cause it still worsens it feeling like no one loves you no one cares you don t deserve to be loved and if you have friends they don t understand you or you can t be honest be yourself around them yeah it s hard to develop a relationship when one or both are depressed but it can literally cure it or put someone back on the right path give them hope if they involved themselves with a good person who s mentally stable and empathic unfortunately people like us attract bad people like a magnet it s difficult i m currently at a point where i think i m better off alone no one can hurt me and being alone is less lonely than having friends who can t accept you for who you are or how you feel\n",
            "hello i need someone to talk to about my depression i honestly don t care who writes to me the main thing is that he or she helps me and doesn t say something like love you the way you are or something like that i m scared of killing myself because i want to get to know someone who really likes me beforehand but my psychologist can t really help me but as i said i would like to have the experience of having a true boyfriend but because i ll probably be myself until then i ll kill if i have no one to write with i just need someone i have no friends and my family hates me so i hope that someone reads this and at least tries to help me my discord flixuspetronus please be an depressed teen like me and btw sorry for my terrible english\n",

            "i ve only posted something like this once i deleted it after all of my acquaintances started texting me saying are you okay do you need help i m always there for you your loved and cared for and it just made me feel worse that s what i feel like i have no one to turn to because i won t let anyone do so i don t know what i m asking for\n",

            "well can you blame them everyone has a hard life and trying to make it better someone who is constantly dragging them down and sapping their energy how is that a friend you re using them as an emotional dumpster what have you done for them friendship goes both ways and people don t owe you anything sorry\n",

            "i am feeling this exact feeling right now i have so much to do but i feel too numb to even start but you ve somehow inspired me to do something about that so for the first step i m going to just force myself to sit at my desk not too hard i guess and then i m going to play my favorite playlist on youtube to make my hellish tasks a little bit fun at least and finally i m going to start studying for my chemistry test even if i can only manage to do it for five minutes that s better than lying in bed like i m doing right now and it s happened to me in the past where i started crying because of all the stuff that i procrastinated doing love cramming before end of year exams but i forgave myself because i wasn t going to finish anything otherwise it s incredibly difficult but you have to stop thinking about what you could have done and just focus on what you can do right now you have all the power to change that my dad always says that motivation only comes after your first action maybe that applies to you too right now i feel like if i can do a little bit it might inspire me to do more anyway all the best to you op i know you can tackle whatever it is you want to accomplish 3\n",
            "yeah depression messes with people that way my depression manifests with self doubt and self loathing this creates a cycle of not doing anything because i m not doing anything i ve found it best to allow my self to forget the past mistakes and look towards the things i can control you can t fix past mistakes but you can plan goals and succeed in the future so forgive your past self and work towards those goals this is much easier said then done\n",
            "this is something ive been dealing with but couldnt ever find the right words to describe it this is it\n",
            "i am wondering this too i m actually nostalgic for times when in hindsight i could have done something i then end up daydreaming about that situation done right and then that makes me depressed and i waste more time being depressed\n",
            "same sometimes i wonder what kind of thing i would have accomplished by now if it werent for my mental heath issues the only thing that probably helps is to set small achievable goals for yourself each day for example instead of deciding that you re gonna clean your entire appartment that day make sure you at least clean your desk and have that as your only priority for the day that way you will at least not be dissapointed with yourself and maybe you ll end up doing even more than just that tiny thing baby steps\n",
            "i dont really have good advice for doing what needs to be done when depressed because i still struggle with that myself i ve been telling myself to clean my apartment for the last 3 months ok this weekend i ll actually do it and of course i never can find the time or effort to actually do it but in terms of wasting time i want to share my perspective because it might help coming out of college i just happened to be friends with a bunch of people in high school who happened to be brilliant intellectually i kid you not that they were all hired right out of college to amazing companies boeing microsoft amazon one became a software engineer at a coding company another went to graduate school at stanford of course i was a music major and spent the better part of a decade in the shittiest of jobs mostly in food service i was so depressed that this period is just one long haze in my memories because everything felt the same to me i would be up all night thinking the very thing you posted about why am i wasting my life why am i not smart enough to do what my friends are doing etc eventually i found a not miserable career it s not something that i m super passionate about but its comfortable makes enough money and i can see myself doing it for 5 years some of my friends who went to those companies are still happy but others arent going to a good job didnt mean they were happy for life what i realized is life isnt a competition for who can make the most money or be happiest the happiest people arent competing they re just consciously making choices to improve the chances they ll be happy that s why depression is so hard because it forces you to make choices that will make you less happy so by focusing on getting a good job and fighting my depression i ve gotten to a place where i m not happy atm but i can at least have hope that i ll be at that place someday and i dont waste as much time thinking about what if i guess if i had to boil down my too long answer it s just to say try to focus on your future as much as you can which i get is hard with depression but it s what helped change my mindset and keeps me from thinking about things out of my control anyways sorry for the long answer but this post really spoke to me because it s something i struggled with for a long long time\n",
            "same i just spent the last 5 5 years in college and a lot of that was just being depressed not thinking about the future in this time i feel like i didn t make the contacts that were necessary to secure a good job or meaningful connections and im just even more depressed now i m about to graduate and really not sure how to get on my own two feet and that just piles on to depression and low sense of self worth\n",
            "how can we forgive ourselves for all the things we did not become doc luben i think this is a problem a lot of people have i often find myself at the end of the week with a pile of tasks that need done because i pushed them off to lay in bed or just sit there so i feel your pain\n",
            "an important thing i learned but is hard to remember in the beginning is that action comes before motivation physics bodies at rest tend to stay at rest bodies in motion tend to stay in motion or look at it like a healthy addiction you re training yourself to become addicted to the little high you get from accomplishment over time the little stuff isn t enough so you move on to bigger projects\n",
            "i ve always found that to do lists are a great way to go whether you re writing down simple everyday things like brush teeth or more specific tasks you re exerting control on the situation you are the best source of motivation for yourself and this is a concrete way of doing it rather than just a vague sense of thinking positive or as you say forcing yourself on a night time you can think what did i do today and even if it s just one or two small things that s something hopefully it will help to start forming better habits but even if it doesn t you can always fall back on writing a list as a starting point to getting things done also i find that allowing myself to put something off but only once works well too i ll do that tomorrow okay i might not but that means i ll have to do it the following day\n",
            "think like a gorilla no predators around belly s full i m sitting here that s what i ll do just sit here im not going to arrange sticks i m not going to stockpile of leaves i m going to sit and chill and that s enough\n",

            "yep yep can totally relate i try not to worry about it and just focus on doing one tiny half assed thing at it time like washing only one dish kind of tiny i won t lie it s not easy but it allows me to get some things done also during my darker periods only worry about only what has to be done or else today deadlines and don t worry about the rest\n",
            "yo i find it helpful to separate my sense of self into two types when this thought cycle happens 1 what how i am currently taking into account what burden i face with my mind taking into account the uphill battle that is depression its symptoms and effects 2 what how i want to be be it tomorrow the near future or future self generally the longing for me to be productive a functioning person who gets their shit done with this in mind i often find that when i am experiencing depressive moods ill give a substantial amount of negative energy into comparing 1 the current version of myself lazy unproductive worthless you know the common depressive thoughts to 2 what i want myself to be like not depressed productive a normal person i find that this might be a source of the problem comparing myself to the perfect ideal version i have in my head and feeling despair because i m not like that therefore inducing the negative thought cycle when things get rough and i begin feeling this way i remind myself that logically all the issues that mental health causes are not going to be fixed in a day they certainly arent going to be fixed at the moment i m feeling depressed which allows me to cut myself some slack gain perspective and rationalise things the advice i d give to you you cant fix all of your issues with a snap of a finger it is unreasonable to hold yourself accountable to the expectations you have of yourself being ideal so dont beat yourself up about it don t be too hard on yourself while its true the big black dog has possibly hindered on your life and productivity remind yourself that you are on the journey of healing rome wasnt built in a day and your crafting of 1 into 2 will not finish in a day as long as you re taking forward steps no matter the size of them you should be proud of yourself the fact that you have an awareness a dislike for the way you feel now and being potentially unproductive means that you have a good understanding of your mental space right now you can use this as means of motivating yourself you got this we all have it just takes time 3\n",

            "same it makes me so sad thinking about the years i ve lost from depression i feel like i m passed the age where you re brain is all that malleable it s much harder to develop new skills for me than it was ten years ago but i lost the last ten years just laying in bed on the internet playing chess or browsing reddit or watching deviant porn i was too afraid to interact with people because i felt like i always embarrassed myself and i was too depressed to motivate myself into doing anything productive i used to be smart school was easy for me now i m trying to do grad school and i have to read each page four or five times just to understand any of it and even then i forget everything by the next day anyways my brain feels fried from not using it for so many years i haven t even finished a book since 2017 and before that it was since 2015 not only has depression basically made me retarded i was once fairly employable and bounced around a couple of decent jobs for some time after undergrad but none of the jobs extended contracts with me and one of them fired me because i never did any work i was always just too depressed and tired to get myself to do anything and now i have a giant gap in my resume and zero employable skills i had to move back in with my parents and i m 28 figured i would give grad school a shot but i m already fucking up if i don t start studying this instant i will fail because midterms are this week and i know next to nothing as of right now this shit sucks so hard even if it gets better i ll never get those years back ugh i wish i had the courage to kill myself\n",

            "as many have said it could be manic episodes which make you feel motivated i ve experienced this myself and have been diagnosed with bipolar 2 though i don t know if i actually have it what helps me is gabapentin which helps the crippling anxiety that causes the depression secondly forming good habits and sticking to them no matter how you feel has been essential for me one such habit or routine that i have that helps is walking atleast a few miles a day i walk to work which is a mile and a half away then work requires walking due duties in my store third i listen to audio books about positive things during my walks things such as how to be more effective at something i m interested in which in my case is being more healthy the subtle art of not giving a f ck and how to win friends and influence others were my starters for instance making habits and routines has been helpful makes me feel more accomplished and they in my case help change my perspective of things in a positive manner\n",
            "very similar situation for me i get days or hours or sometimes weeks where i feel amazing confident full of energy secure in my friendships and relationship and eating rigjt and exercising followed by periods where i cant get out of bed i feel unable to have professional job i hate exercise eat nothing but junk and hate my face so much i think no one could ever want me i feel needy and clingy and that everyone hates me no middle ground ever\n",

            "i am currently in that crash period just yesterday i was so productive and optimistic back to being shit i guess\n",
            "yeah definitely i ve had a few days in a row now where i have felt like a normal person again but i can t stop bracing myself for the inevitable crash any minute now i m seeing a psych next week to find out if that s my depression or something else\n",
            "yes what helps me is remembering progress is a squiggly line basically that it is not linear for me sometimes if i find clarity i will freak myself out if i feel less clear the next day but repeating this phrase over and over the past two years has helped me heal with much more patience for myself take it easy and be kind to yourself treat yourself like a person don t just try to force yourself to get better or push yourself like a work horse i think this brings back the depression because on some level you realize that you re just trying to feel better instead of actually try to get better trust that if you got to that spot of clarity you can get there again and then even better you re doing wonderfully\n",
            "i somehow manage my highs and lows along with being in med school it s super tough for me sometimes there are so many days where i just can t get out of bed for hours and waste half my day sometimes my lows coincide with practical exams where i have to demonstrate physical exams in front of a physician this brings out my worst in terms of anxiety and i fall apart and fail the exam i can usually bounce back for the next practical which is a couple weeks later but it s frustrating to fail things that i know i can be really good at\n",
            "yes the key is always to remember that your mind is shitting the bed do the exact opposite of what it says at first you will succumb but later with more experience you will build discipline that will beat it you might still have a shitty mindset but with the help of discipline you ll make tremendous progress that months before that you wouldn t even imagine would happen and yet still even after all that you will feel like shit but when looking into the eyes of progress you ll understand how deceptive depression is feel better and keep pushing that s how the cycle always plays for me though with time the effects of depression are weakening and less cultivating than before\n",
            "i am going through the same sometimes there are sparks of motivation and will to live but those are far too less and when reality strikes i just get can t stand the thought of living the only thing keeping me from suucide is my mother because i can t leave her alone in this world\n",

            "i ve always heard you are your worse enemy and i truly believe that just the other day outta no where i had a anxiety attack it had been several weeks since my last one and i had thought maybe they were behind me i had been being more positive about myself and keep my thoughts about the future and not dwelling in the past then yesterday morning i get up and all my horrible self hating thoughts come down on me like a ton of bricks i stayed on my room so my roommates wouldn t see my break down as soon as i could get myself somewhat stable i got out and took my meds and started cleaning and working to let me mind rest i feel for you guys that deal with things like what i deal with it sucks and all i can saw is work with your self and i hope you can learn ways to move past you dark thoughts\n",
            "just keep fighting you re supposed to want to crash and give up if it was easy everyone would do it i had my first day back in the gym today and didn t have the greatest workout and after i was really hard on myself but i m going to go again tomorrow and the next day and the day after that because i want to achieve this goal so badly you got this keep fighting i believe in you\n",

            "i have ups and downs like this too at time i feel really happy and ready to do anything then just suddenly it ll change and everything feels empty and i have no motivation for me there s usually a trigger that changes how i feel from simple things like finishing a netflix show and having nothing to watch to things like being excluded in a friend group\n",
            "uh yeah it s hard to gauge what i m feeling most days but i know i m not happy everything i feel is like a soft whisper in my head telling me how to react so that i don t accidentally get put in a mental hospital\n",

            "god i feel this i don t think it is severe enough to be bipolar at least in my case as it has been ruled out by psychiatrists but i get this so often and just got back into one of the slumps i just get so excited that maybe something will work and feel better and then motivation wanes something bad happens or it just doesn t work and i crash no idea how to make it better\n",
            "yes and every time it comes with a realization that i won t ever be happy\n",
            "yeah this happens in cycles a lot for me i d be feeling better and more motivated for a time but then depressing thoughts and stress starts creeping back in and i eventually give up on everything and go back to being miserable i m handling it better now but i still always worry i ll crash again the longer the happiness streak the worse the breakdown is\n",
            "i m pretty sure that a depressive episode i ve had multiple this year my last one was really nice but i feel like shit now so yay\n",
            "dude this is literally me i started to make times when i start and stop feeling said to get a good view on when it happens during the day to me it usually happens very early in the morning and sometimes at night\n",
            "i have this i attribute this to being in shit situation confused i m working towards bettering my situation but it s gonna take time i get frustrated\n",
            "i can relate to you i have been experiencing these periods for 18 years it s an eternal spiral the more time you spend in the spiral the worst you feel escape from there is not easy you get hopes and they are crushed again harder the worst thing is having a hope crushed i wish you the best and hope you and manage to get out of there my friend\n",
            "yea i really understand this this happens alot until you are constantly i said crash state\n",
            "things work better in a state of flow but dont force the flow or things go out of wack the harder you push the faster you crack it seems like when you accept yourself wholeheartedly and acknowledge your merits you can grow stronger that state of mind is just tough to get to when you re tired and you just want to sleep\n",
            "the worst part is that this period of super high motivation happens just as i m about to go to bed already in bed then i fall asleep then i wake up and nothing back to being a slob\n",
            "i have gone through that i felt motivated optimistic so my decision tend to be rash then when i do my responsibility i keep asking myself why did i choose that but i think i actually have the ability to gone through all those so i hope you keep believing in yourself\n",
            "yes i feel like im going through that period right now im so glad im not alone on this\n",
            "literally me today i had a great week i found a terrific book did well in a social situation and i felt like i was on a course to bettering myself then a manager said someone complained about me and he needs to talk to me about it and i feel like i wasted my time reading the book and i should never think positively about myself ever again because i was wrong to feel that way and i dont deserve happiness tough spot to be in\n",
            "honestly this was me today had a great weekend getting some things lined up for the week then 2pm start a task make a shopping list but not able to complete the task then breaks down entirely and cancels my plan for the evening that i ve been waiting for 2 weeks to go to this nonsense is difficult but you are not alone with this feeling\n",
            "it gets annoying to a point where you just want to stay in that sad state and not care about anything else\n",
            "almost every night although it takes different forms i get overwhelmed and things don t go perfectly ocd kicks in and then i get very upset and give up each time it gets worse and worse i call it sisyphus it s a big part of my issue and you describe something similar i wake up fine it s all downhill from there some people wake up depressed i am literally the opposite it all gets worse until i can t take it anymore\n",
            "mine cycles could be years or months i had 3years being clean and happy but after that a work burnout drove me into the dumps i haven get out there yet and then another burnout still tryin to climb out of it though im in a dip period again medical help did prevent me and help me get out of the suicidal self harm zone so far i have been kept safe that way so i still have chances to work my way up again\n",
            "when you feel the motivation do you do something with it i get where you are coming from but i think that what matters is doing something when you don t feel that motivation which is hard and something i want to work on\n",
            "this happens to me whenever i try to embark on a great adventure towards greener pastures i would go on an abyss vacation every now and then because of this recently i ve been thinking only about the things i need to do immediately i do not know what day it is or how long it s been i would just set reminders a week in advance in case i need to do something big the skies have never been clearer the clouds are still there but they don t bother me that much\n",
            "me rn i had a great period a week ago and now i m crashing hard again\n",
            "i would see a doctor and see if you have pmdd i would get motivated in spurs along with a bunch of other things that actually sounded similar to bipolar i then realized this would only occur a week before my period monthly i got put on a better birth control and what i though could be bipolar was actually pms on crack\n",
            "me yesterday it was bad and i d feel even more shit if i talk about it\n",
            "moment like this often come to me the sudden wave of motivation to make my situation better but in the end i didn t do anything or things stopped halfway and i just feeling even worse than before\n",
            "omg yes today i got bad news about asking for my salary adjustment at work and it was a punch to the gut really feels like whatever i do the universe keeps throwing monkey wrenches at me my comfort zone is going to sleep and that s what i did i still feel shitty but i know this is not the end of me i m a fighter i m a survivor\n",
            "happiness scares me i cower away from it because i believe the happier i am the greater i will fall\n",
            "i have my ups and downs but while the ups stay at about the same level the down is always steeper the further i move on\n",
            "wait that happened to me for 4 years now i can t even feel more depressed than i am right now so it kinda fixed itself\n",
            "i don t know if it counts but i just share what happened just this morning did the regular run which has been detoeriating in performance but during the run i kept thinking about what the wise one sadhguru mentioned about living and not sleeping in life which then i finally decided to not waste wait anymore since there isn t a perfect time to wait for i been holding back the overseas trip in hope to break my bad routine habits i have my reasons to hold back but anyways i thought of deciding to go back home after bathing the first thing to do is to book without thinking of any possible negativity or lack of justification end up realising that the cost had bumped twice and the hotel time slots are limited i immediately pulled back again dwelling back into the rabbit hole started self blaming again this feeling of failure although not the first time but the amount of time wasted is just hiaz too much\n",
            "yes and it s already affecting me and my group works i wish i could just keep my motivation to keep going so i don t burden them so much\n",
            "more often than i would care to admit looking back it s often a product of my own actions it tends to go like this 1 decide what changes i want to make and start working on them 2 keep a consistent schedule and feel good about progress 3 miss a day due to outside forces such as long day at work or other distraction 4 fall off the boat and start skipping days because the precedent has already been set 5 feel bad about not meeting goal while simultaneously thinking why aren t i happy i m trying all these changes 6 release i wasn t as dedicated as i should have been and start back over at step 1\n",
            "yes i regularly motivate myself plan my day and get started and then part way through the day i spiral and find it hard to concentrate or get anything done which makes me feel even worse that the start of the day\n",
            "yeah i do some days i feel good and try to be productive i m unemployed so i try my best to find a job then after a while all the guilt and pressure of not being better and decisive just swallows me\n",
            "100 every single time i get motivated as all fuck like plans that will get my life together i start a workout routine buy healthy food make a cleaning schedule it s like my depression never even existed this is usually day 2 or 3 of my cycle by day 5 i m so overwhelmed exhausted that i crash burn immediately feel terrible about myself for weeks then back to the same cycle\n",
            "well i feel the same with that situation being motivated is much more difficult challenges the more i pushed everything that makes me so painful is more depressed than i feel in same way\n",
            "yes niko case sums it up perfectly in the song a better son daughter the lows are so extreme that the good seems fucking cheap and it teases you for weeks in its absence caveat i can only speak from my own experience i ve been in therapy for years and am very paranoid about being bipolar as it runs in my family there have been several therapists psychiatrists who have assured me the highs are simply normalcy and not intense enough to be classified as bipolar having periods of feeling normal functioning ok dare i say good then sinking back into depression is not uncommon\n",
            "i ve had this happen on a small scale my last super deep depression came on because of how my husband was being treated though he was in the service and we were living overseas and very very alienated that did not help i have dysthymia persistent depressive disorder pdd and general anxiety disorder so generally i m either depressed and simply going through the motions or i m anxious about everything and trying to juggle everything at the same time taking on too much causes problems and eventually failures of some kind and they wear me down and then i m in a depressive funk again it s been a sort of cycle throughout my life i just never know when i m going to go from one to the other\n",
            "yeah 100 man happens to me all the time especially to do with school work i ll wake up one morning and be like i m actually excited to do some work and then just a couple of hours later or maybe not even that length of time i just want to get back into bed\n",
            "yes this has happened to me a lot in the past it happens when i am trying to do too much too quickly when i change the pace to small incremental steps it does not happen there is a book by author barbara scher that explains why this happens and how to circumvent it i believe it has something to do with your brain amygdala trying to protect you her techniques have worked for me\n",
            "this post and the comments seriously helped me see something in myself and the patterns i ve been living the last few months so thank you\n",
            "i think it s normal but be free to correct me it always happen to me every time i think there is some light pouring into my life it only goes darker\n",
            "experience this alot and recently i had a good period and everything went well until a few days ago and if i have to re live it once again im done\n",
            "sometimes the all good everything times usually don t last long and all of a sudden i distance myself from everyone periods differ a lot from time to time depending on what s going on try to enjoy the small things in life it ll help a lot altough it may take years as it is not an easy task and depression will haunt you through your life if you have survived all these years i m sure you ll be able to see yourself grow into a fine human being\n",
            "that happened to me today actually i decided i wanted to try and lose weight so i started running and trying to eat better along with that i opened a savings account to try and put some money away for a rainy day my dad told me today that i m putting too much money away in my savings account and i guess it was just the feeling that i did something wrong even though i was trying to do good that made me crash again i ve been trying to pick myself back up for most of the day\n",
            "how does one deal with this i have this too i thought i was the only one\n",
            "pretty much everyday i feel more and more disconnected from people my age as well as family members i just feel so out tune these days i have no idea what i m doing with my life although that s something that some of feel as well not knowing what their purpose in life is i do believe that it gets better eventually it s just hard\n",
            "i sometimes get motivated for minutes and then i m sad and sluggish again sometimes its hours sometimes its days sometimes it s a week and after i ve been motivated i get incredibly sad\n",
            "i have this problem just the other day i was feeling super motivated feeling like i was going up in the world when all of a sudden this huge wave of depression came and i had couple mental breakdowns\n",
            "everytime somebody in my class gets an award that i think i could ve won i get really pissed off and depressed then i try to study even harder at home realise i can t concentrate and i m shit at the subject and then go into a period where i just don t give a shit whether or not i do well i used to be a really high scoring student but now i just don t care anymore today like 10 minutes ago was the 4th year where everybody in my class won an achievement or certificate except yours truly i ve honestly just given up now\n",
            "the more i try my best to better myself at work and do something right at work i get pulled down and picked on for doing something right its just hurting me so bad i m always depressed now i used to be so happy what happened don t get me wrong there are times where i am happy but most of the time i just sit and cry out of nowhere the environment at work is so draining i get looked down on and bullied i even tell the truth then i get underestimated for the things i do or say i feel like i have no motivation anymore ever since i have been depressed\n",
            "yes all the time i have good days and bad days but the bad days far outnumber the good ones\n",
            "yes i feel that way myself i get maybe a month at a time when i feel on top of the world and then i free fall back to being unmotivated what gets me through knowing that it won t last forever that at least i ll have happiness again we just have to fight on matter how bleak we feel\n",
            "i have totally experienced that but not on my period because i m a guy but yeah\n",
            "i feel this once worked somewhere where a manager of another area had a break down and was off for a few month she came back was out smoking with my then manager and conversation got onto the breakdown and my manager said to other manager along the lines of i m so sorry to hear what you ve been through if there s anything i can do to help or you need someone to talk too i m here about a year later i had some degree of a breakdown was suffering from ptsd depression and was in an acute anxiety state eventually braved it and told my manager only for her to turn round and day i don t believe in mental health problems you re lying you re attention seeking and if you don t stop i ll find a way to make you stop thankfully got out of that place pretty quick but man that hurt\n",
            "felt everyone s always gonna hop on that bell let s talk train but as soon as you show any symptoms of mental illness you re labelled toxic lazy ungrateful etc whenever mental health day comes around everyone posts suicide hotlines but they can t be bothered to check up on their friends or simply listen to them i just wish these people knew that we are aware of our actions we know we re being toxic we know we drain you everything feels overwhelming because that s what it s like in our heads all the time we just don t know how to stop and it s not our faults\n",
            "genuine question what is a response or answer that would feel like support to you what do you want as support from someone who you are reaching out to for support\n",
            "it s because they do not care about them they want everyone to know what a good person they are without actually being a good person\n",
            "yep my friends i was with for over 10 years left me within 6 months of getting depression\n",
            "actually yes people always talked about how important mental health is and everyone should be checking up friends and family but when they actually met one they can t handle those negativity they did nothing to help but worsen the situation they ll think you re troublesome and seeking attention no fun to hangout with all you did was venting and cry if you really need someone rn you can vent on this community nobody would judge you but if it s too public or sensitive to do so i believe someone in the comments would love to listen and help i can listen\n",
            "my mom is a mental health counselor both her and my dad don t believe that i m mentally ill just that i have low self esteem she s the reason i m never getting therapy because if my own mother doesn t believe me then neither will a random stranger i don t know if i ll ever get help honestly\n",
            "people think as long as your alive it s all good but really what s the point of living a dead life why do they want us to suck everything up and carry on forgive me if i m weak but i m tired of putting this charade up and pretend that everything is okay\n",
            "i ll play devil s advocate and say someone supporting mental health treatment doesn t necessarily have to commit to a lifetime of lending an ear to struggling people if they don t want to supporting therapy medicine research government and societal support in forwarding these efforts doesn t mean the person as an individual has to want to play therapist to someone who approaches them quite the opposite if they re acknowledging that mental illness is a real thing and an undesirable state for someone to be in that person would support you in going to get help more than they want to be locked into a conversation with you if they accept that you are an unwell person depressed people are constantly on this sub wanting to tell the rest of the world how to change but one thing depressed people need to accept about themselves is the over thinking and over talking and obsessive patterns they have and one more person who sits and talks with you probably isn t going to do anything for you don t get me wrong i m more on your side than you will think after me saying that i wish everyone would be a wonderful friend to you who would sit and listen rather than throw catchphrases at you but wishing for other people to change is one of the least fruitful things you can do with your time on this planet you can either take that type of behavior as a sign that the person is not actually a good friend to you or that your desires for help and support need to be aimed in a different direction or any number of other conclusions but the least likely thing to happen is that you ll ever get what you want from people who aren t offering it or change society or anything else i always try to encourage depressed people to let friendships and the social contacts that you have be one avenue of life where you can escape your depression for a while rather than use them as another tool for delving into the same depression topics that you are already doing every other hour of the day talk to a friend about something fun or suggest something to do together yes you should be able to vent to friends and receive some support in a perfect world but maybe your friend sees more than you do that another hour talking about whatever is wrong isn t going to do anything better for you\n",
            "when a person talks about someone else they are talking more about herself himself than the other person i always try to think about that in these situations and the reason why i m saying this is because these people just want to kid themselves thinking that they can offer the world some good they can t not because they are useless or smth but mostly because they think depression is something so much smaller than it actually is and when someone comes to them in need for help their answer is these bullshit you said op like think more positively people that actually want to help need to fucking educate themselves if you want to be the lending hand you need to know how heavy the grip will be if you want to stare into the abyss the abyss will stare back at you and if you are not educated for it well you all know what happens\n",
            "i am fucking tired of everyone shouting mental health is important but as soon as i pour my heart out about being depressed they vanish give me a break\n",

            "one reason is that social media is inherently performative the online audience is always there if you say the right things you get ego strokes in the form of likes views etc virtue signaling about mental illness or whatever the cause du jour is this week is what a lot of people do but it s just an act reaching out to them is requiring them to walk the walk not just make the right noises not everyone has the gumption to back up their messages\n",
            "to say to someone just man up is beyond rude however there is tactful ways to turn someone away like acknowledging your own lack of knowledge or that you have your own hands full at the moment do keep in mind not everyone has the training to help you though nor the empathy to listen it doesn t mean they are the demon spawn but its just means its on the average levels i personally try to help out as much as i can but i m not unlimited in my mental battery\n",

            "i have never felt like it was not for attention even when i was alone in my room emotionally broken while me head rested against the mirror\n",
            "this sums up my life bpd tendencies emotional instability from late diagnosed asd adhd anxiety issues all so artfully disguised by depression that ranges from i couldn t possibly be depressed to violently assaulting and verbally abusing my so with death wishes and self loathing i ve had three of the latter snaps this week alone and idk if it s due to 13 years of hormonal contraceptive use being predisposed to mood disorders stress or a mix thereof\n",
            "wow this thread i was just trying to figure out how to trick myself into getting help because of this bad days are so bad i can t get help good days i m glad everything s fine and i clean the house and try to salvage pieces of normalcy and i ve been diagnosed with depression over and over and over again so it s just me being mean to myself because depression i guess\n",

            "all the time i m always telling myself that the only reason why i m feeling this way is because i want attention even though i know it isn t true because i never mention it or i convince myself that i just want to feel special i m invalidating my own issues\n",
            "story of my life and let me tell you even if you have tons of motives to be severely depressed a k a maybe the universe thinks i m bear grylls or chuck norris cause it keeps throwing random shit at me everytime i think i finally past some trauma you still feel like you re lazy and playing victim everytime\n",
            "all the time how are you holding up now im too scared to try therapy im afraid it ll make me go over the edge and have another suicide attempt especially with how toxic the social environment is here but i m definitely open to insight on what it s like i want to get help but i m scared it s going to be the same broken record speech and planning that almost everyone else offers except i m paying an arm and a leg for it\n",
            "i do that too il star to think im depressed i should tell someone i need help i tell a friend or somethin and an hour later im like you fucking idiot what was that for youre not even depressed youre just overreacting to life\n",
            "late to the post but honestly i don t even know at this point i hate myself so much over how i ve never really done anything because i m unmotivated but i m not sure if it s my laziness or depression i almost always feel like i m just lying to myself when i say i m depressed but i also feel like i really am given how i just have no drive to advance in life even though part of me truly wants to be able to support myself\n",
            "same i feel like i m just faking it i feel like i m just pretending to be quirky after all even if i cut myslef i don t cut that much so like i m probably just faking it\n",
            "oh absolutely all the time it s a common symptom of depression afaik if that s any consolation idk if it would help you but try to remember that you d probably react differently if a loved on was telling you they were going through this ie you wouldn t necessarily assume the other person was exaggerating how they were feeling sometimes challenging the negative self loathing voice the one that s telling you you re faking or making a big deal out of nothing with a bit of logic can help put your thoughts irt your situation into perspective at the very least\n",
            "all the time i constantly feel like i m on the edge of a nervous breakdown and feel like doing something reckless like crash my car but of course i don t do that because i have enough self control not to i feel like since i was never hospitalized for my depression and can always hold myself back from actually doing the bad things i think that it s not serious i feel like people with real depression don t have self control when it comes to damaging thoughts\n",
            "i used to do this but then i think enough time passed that i managed to be definitively convinced that it was all true how could i go such a long time barely functioning that cannot be fake took a while years to get there though\n",

            "its just i feel so shallow i can t interpret things right anymore i feel so empty and i constantly want to tell anyone that cares that it hurts it hurts so bad but at the same time i can t feel it i see myself as the good guy in my head but what have i done i pity myself i want others to make it feel better but i dont tell them because it ll just be proving my beliefs better to live in denial then have everyone worry about you\n",
            "yup all my life the mind plays tricks on you like that i ve been trying my best to trust my past self when i m depressed i make it a point to ask myself can i just snap out of this can i help myself effectively if not then i know it s my depression when i feel that guilt after recovering i remember what i asked myself and trust that the pain was too much\n",
            "hell yeah i even dissociate and suffer from derealization because i can t tell if i m the same person when i am sad or happy it s driving me crazy\n",
            "i wouldn t say depressed but i feel very very sad and utterly hopeless sometimes and i feel like people don t wana talk to me but i don t wanna talk to them either i have sadness come and go like common cold\n",
            "best videos on the topic you will ever see keep in mind that it s satire and also that there is no straightforward meaning read descriptions\n",
            "i have something similar one day i can have a mental breakdown in a bathroom cut myself and skip school and the next day i m totally fine i feel worse for being happy by remembering those bad days and then i get even sadder when i m already depressed thinking that i m not really depressed i m just weak overreacting\n",
            "yeah i barely even want to comment on this for fear of the one person i think might know i m on here so i ll probably delete this i don t fake it for attention i try to hide it i don t want anyone to know i m battling this because i feel like they d be shocked i m part of a strong group of friends and i ve always been there for anyone and everyone in my group and outside of it but in the last few years i feel like i m fucking up i have a home but it never seems good enough i have a business but i feel like it s a failure i haven t had a relationship i enjoyed since high school which was only one the only one i had outside of high school i fucking hated i don t believe i m attractive i feel pretty trapped in my job but fear i ll dislike any alternative more i could go on but i also get very pissed at myself for even feeling this way because i ve been here before and gotten out of it with things like exercise which is normally a huge part of my life i doubt anyone will even read this reading all of your comments at once makes me feel better about myself and also makes me think i shouldn t be here because it just draws me deeper kind of feel like my life has been a fuck up for the last while not sure how i got here but i truly wish you all the best\n",
            "i feel guilty whenever i entertain the possibility that i have depression my therapist said i did but i end up thinking that i must have guided the conversation in a way to make her think that so i d have pity points or an excuse for how gross i am i feel like it s an insult to the people who are really suffering and i get suicidal thoughts often but it s not like it s every moment of every day there are periods when i don t get them for weeks but other times i can t get them out of my head but even that is fake bullshit my brain must ve created to further victimize me because i ve never even attempted self harm let alone suicide i think about it a lot but i ve never even tried to do it and that makes me hate myself more i m such a disgusting coward\n",
            "all the time i don t even know what s wrong with me at this point i don t really care anymore tbh like i m just numb so everything\n",
            "all the fucking time i can relate to many of the symptoms but at the same time i think to myself what if i m just doing this for attention because i see a lot of memes about teenage girls saying they re depressed when they re not and i think to myself 16f is that what i m doing\n",
            "i mean i think like im confused and i think that i obviously dont have depression tho my friends that know about my so called depression think i do and sometimes i just think that im doing it for attention eventhough i have no idea why i d do that\n",
            "games like dark souls 3 which i am finishing playing make me feel worse cuz i tell myself how worthless i am and what trash i am to basically have a panic attack over a game which makes no fucking sense\n",
            "bro why you gotta do this to me this is exactly what i do every single day\n",
            "i had the exact same problem i finally admitted to myself that i have depression and from then i learned to take some steps forward to manage it on my own now i tell myself that i live with depression but manage it in order to mold into being normal i think of it as simply an illness or a condition like adhd and such no one else does but i do so in turn i just give myself a break from time to time like screw it ill just call myself off of work and play video games all day why not or hell what if i m not progressing on my fitness goal one day won t hurt i know what i need and i don t let anyone tell me otherwise i kind of accepted that this simply is my way of life now and that there is really no cure sorry if this didn t help i just wanted to share my piece\n",
            "i think i do this but it s hard to take myself seriously i have diaries full of how i feel going back ages but every time i look at them i decide that i m being dramatic\n",
            "fuck this is exactly what i am going through right now i feel like a fraud just thinking about seeing a doctor worse what if i actually am just pretending to feel special i made this fucking alt account just l to write this i spent the last two hours looking for a reason not to go see a doctor tomorrow as i planned for a few days now i took so many online depression tests and everytime i see the result or try to select an honset answer i feel like i must be lying pretending to justify why i can t get anything done i am struggling just hitting sent on this what an attention seeking move this would be am i even honest to me i hate this\n",
            "yeah my ex girlfriend we re still friends now we ve talked about the abuse manipulation that happened and have worked through it used to tell me that i didn t deserve to feel depressed suicidal and that i would never fully understand what it would feel like it happened a little under two years ago but now i don t open up to my friends the closest i get is sending sad tiktoks saying that the algorithm is too specific and wondering if they ll notice\n",
            "idk what i feel anymore but a day doesn t go by where i think something s wrong but i genuinely feel like i m being dramatic or that just because i m not particularly suicidal that i don t have depression because other people have it worse i just don t know what to do i feel lonely and like i have no one to talk to even though i have people to talk to i just can t\n",
            "yes you re not alone in this feeling it s taken years of therapy for me to even remotely believe i m not just an attention seeking lazy useless human being i have quite a few friends who have had much worse home lives than i so i always told myself that i was selfish for being depressed those damn chemicals\n",
            "this this this this i m glad i m not the only one also sorry for experiencing this\n",
            "that s exactly what i keep doing confused if i need help or i just need to stop making myself believe i do where do we draw the fucking line\n",

            "kati morton therapist youtuber has a good video on this topic on her channel it s a pretty common pattern it seems because being depressed is what you know so it s comfortable and predictable even if it feels shitty while not being depressed sounds sooo foreign unknown and scary to your mind\n",

            "it s difficult because it feels like the depression has become such an intrinsic part of me that i wonder who i d be without it am i actually an introvert or is that my depression making me avoid people idk idk who i am or what i could be without my depression and that in itself is so scary that it makes me feel even more worthless\n",
            "thats why i try not to ask my friends for a listening ear too much even if they told me that they are there for me a small part of me is always wondering if they are judging me for being depressed too long or its been 3 months why havent she recovered yet despite being given a lot of advice\n",
            "i think that s just one more trick our sick brain is playing on us to make us feel even worse it s yet another form of self blaming a hallmark of the depressive state the truth is no one would knowingly choose to suffer this hell if he knew any better looking at healthy happy people doesn t give you any knowledge as to how they are doing it in fact even they have no idea how they were just blessed with a healthy mind so those people can preach until the sun is blue how you should do that and think that but it s complete bs if i could i surely would\n",

            "ugh these types of posts absolutely break my heart i hope that i m not too late but i ll show you why this is not true i blame the psychotherapy industry for creating this narrative psychotherapy is based on the ideas of personal responsibility and individualism that align heavily with american culture psychotherapy is unique to western culture and interestingly enough shares many similarities with witch doctors in other cultures often i hear the phrase it s not your fault but it is your responsibility from the psychotherapy community it s a nice thought but assumes that an individual somehow has the power to influence everything around them including their own thoughts and feelings psychotherapy unfairly shames the distressed individual into thinking that they simply want to be miserable this works excellently for our capitalistic society that depends on maintaining power structures people who think that their distress is their own fault are much less likely to complain you simply cannot help how you feel choose what to think or decide how to behave there is no single agent in your brain that is making decisions there is no ceo of self you are the embodiment of your interactions with the world throughout your life and into the present despite free will and responsibility being necessary concepts for society they are born out of illusion what i would encourage others to consider is what it is in their environment both past and present that has contributed to these feelings we exist and are created within our environment we don t feel depressed for no reason there s a reason that depression is highly correlated with past trauma poverty etc of course your unique biology and lack of access to social support may make you more vulnerable to negative impact by external stressors the power that you have to change these things are likely extremely limited otherwise you would ve done something about them already past events are suspended far in space time beyond your current reach and to blame yourself for being unable to change the effects of them is absolutely ridiculous nonetheless i d encourage everyone to consider what sources of strength they have that they may have never considered for many people this is their relationships but it can be anything i guess what i m trying to say is this is not your fault nobody would ask to be miserable that s the whole point of misery that we don t want it there s no easy answer to any of this but at the very least you and all of the people here deserve to suffer with dignity\n",

            "i ve thought about this before and came to the realization that the reason i still struggle so much with my depression and anxiety is because its all i know i ve struggled with it for all of my adult life and i am genuinely terrified to get better while i do want to get better and live a more happy life i am so afraid of doing that because it s unknown to me\n",
            "i relate to this sentiment so hard thoughts to you at this time i truly believe that our brains can become addicted to depression at the end of the day thoughts are simple chemical reactions in our brain with depression there are very distinct chemical reactions that send specific signals through our mind and body after long enough in this state the brain is convinced it needs those chemical reactions the brain will force negative thoughts on you in order to achieve the unfortunate spike that happens chemically i m actually in the process of treating it with 12 step excercises lately\n",
            "the way i see it is that the reason we are in this kind of world is because most of the people don t care if everyone would be as depressed and has as much anxiety about climate change for example we d do something about it\n",
            "my counsellor told me that it may be my personality trait i obviously got defensive and told her that my lack of motivation was probably not that but my overwhelming desire to actually do work but then knowing i ll do it bad anyway even though i know that ever since that day i can t seem to get it out of my head maybe this is my personality\n",

            "man i wish this were true for me because it would mean that i ve actually had a way out all of this time instead i end up depressed randomly when things are fine or even just plain neutral or i get pmdd and am reminded that this will likely continue happening for the rest of my life i really wish i were deciding to be depressed somewhere it might give me hope my brain has other ideas though\n",

            "i ve felt like this most of my life i don t know how else to put it but i was raised to be high functioning it didn t matter how bad things were there were things that had to be done and i had to do them no matter what there are days i resent people who break am angry the only emotion i might feel in a day at them i want to break i want to hit rock bottom i want to be so far down that people notice and maybe give a damn like they do for people who break recently my psych asked if i wanted to take medical leave i declined if i did that i d be invisible and i can t face that every day i feel like screaming but i don t have the energy for it what energy i have is used up on doing what needs to be done and wearing the fat suit\n",
            "hard yes omg i am just so tired of everything i want to quit but then that s letting the depression win some days it s like i m draining double the energy because i m in a constant uphill climb but then i m like gotta keep climbing otherwise i might die super fun\n",

            "yup i feel exactly the same way a friend of mine had a psychotic breakdown a couple of months ago he was later diagnosed with bpi and what i thought at the time was i want that i feel like shit inside i ve tried to kill myself why can t i just break down and show everyone outside then at least i d know that i m really mentally ill and not just faking my depression which is how i feel a lot of the time i just want proof for myself and for everyone around me i want my being to just openly break down and scream i m not okay but i can t even do that right\n",
            "i work out i have my shower i eat properly and even manage to study but every day i crack up and cry out of nothing the hurtful feeling of emptiness might catch me in the middle of my workout studying time and there are always people around so i can t cry and i carry this emptiness each and every day\n",

            "i m also sick of constantly feeling like i m about to break this so much this\n",
            "i feel like my mind is a see saw one side is acceptance and perseverance and positivity that things will get better i can always go back to school and i ll eventually have a well paying job in which i don t need to depend on roommates i ll get to travel anywhere i want eventually i m a human who makes mistakes and i m learning from them and then there is the other side that focuses on all the things that i am lacking all the things i have yet to accomplish or cannot do the comparisons the self doubt the feeling that things aren t going to get better and i m just using eventually as a band aid to deny how worthless i am and the see saw just goes back and forth every day\n",
            "i can strongly relate feeling like that is hard you re functioning and trying to show everyone that everything s great but deep down you feel awful don t let anyone underestimate the pain you re going through each mental illness has it s own struggles keep fighting i hope you get to feel better soon\n",
            "yeah it s like oh you can t suffer that badly you can go to the store and take the bus and like bitch i am used to hiding all my feelings inside i could break any moment so fuck off\n",
            "not really i mean i m obviously extremely unhappy but i wouldn t prefer to be totally non functional i can t imagine why anyone would\n",
            "i empathize with this it s almost that if i m high functioning do i even have depression to begin with then if it s not dragging me over the coals and destroying all aspects of my life does it inverse to be just being normal and having really shitty days or moments\n",
            "abso fucking lutely just because i can seemingly function normally doesn t mean i am not dragging my ass and feeling like i am dying inside i get up and work full time run a side business am a father am a husband and i work out during all of these and during whatever else i am doing i feel completely empty numb fatigued unmotivated and the physical side effects such as dizziness wreak hell on my mind and body i ve been checked by many doctors and specialists but due to seeming normal i guess people think it can t be that bad i guess i am not taken as seriously as someone who is stuck in bed all day crying people think i can just push through and read a self help motivational book or some shit and it isn t true i ve tried a variety of ways to receive help and still over the years i am stuck feeling like this sometimes slightly better sometimes way worse but never fully better anxiety and depression are absolutely obliterating my quality of life the meds help some things but i still feel like shit and i ve tried many meds supplements therapy acupuncture etc\n",
            "constant struggle and honestly i hate when i get like this after a bout of happiness why can t i grab that feeling and hold onto it shit doesn t last nearly long enough\n",
            "i ve been where you are now and sometimes still go there and would go there more often if i hadn t made some significant changes in my life proper meds of course were essential to begin with but next were life changes i learned what triggered me and made feel this way and why i removed negative people from my life including family if necessary i learned to make better choices in how i dealt with people and how i let them affect me i found a job type which was less stressful yet still provided the level of earnings i wanted so i was were you are and much worse 24 years ago i d say i finally got to where you are about 6 years ago there is hope it can happen but not overnight and not without significant work on your part\n",
            "functional depression it s a fucking bitch i somehow have convinced the people in my life that i m okay i m in grad school which probly helps the illusion i can get my shit done but i don t remember the last time i was happy\n",
            "yes sometimes i wish i could just completely shut down not get out of bed not shower not talk and not eat for an extended period of time\n",
            "i m sick of feeling like things might get better for a day or two then returning to suicidal thoughts i ve been holding down a stressful job stressful for me anyway and can t count the days i ve almost walked off and threw everything i ve been working towards away\n",
            "as someone who lived high functioning or 18 years and also looked happy as fuck i eventually got sick of people not listening when i said i was gonna break so one day i just stopped stopped work school eating brushing my teeth it was fiction awesome for like a month it s been six years now and i can t hold a job i shower once sometimes twice a month i haven t brushed my teeth in six years my teeth are really loose and i ve forget how to socialize in real life because everyone treats me like i m diseased or crazy you can t go on living like that but i suggest you take a day off or call in sick every once in awhile because you have to let loose just don t give in because it is a hella lot harder to put yourself back together that it is holding together\n",
            "yeeeeeep it s like treading water with the constant fear of drowning but never actually committing to it it s a maddening way to live your life because you can t even point to the thing and say see i m depressed as fuck and it disables me inside because outside you re working and going to school and getting shit done i ve learned it s likely a survival mechanism from my childhood to be functionally suicidal and severely depressed because if i didn t perform normalcy excellence and happiness at all times i was beaten for it so i could not show or express negative emotions i just kept going except now as i m getting older and have had treatment for the ptsd and no longer experience that pressure i actually am getting less and less functional at being depressed and more and more classically depressed which is ruining my fucking life sometimes yeeesh you never win\n",
            "i recently took a bunch of sleeping pills and alcohol but i vomited it all up i wanted so badly not to wake up but i did and just went to work anyway i m so tired of pretending not to be broken and hollow\n",
            "i feel the same way i can easily take care of myself and act like everything is normal but it kills me on the inside i don t want to do any of it i just want to stop and not have to do anything to be free from it all and just be empty hell i d be okay with being a vegetable if it meant i didn t have to deal with this anymore\n",
            "depending on whether you re on a slllloooow upwards trajectory or downwards trajectory previously i hate it now after hitting bottom and slowly rising back into high functioning depression i prefer it than being non functional\n",
            "fuck it sucks everyone thinks i m fine even when i beg for help it s well it could be worse no it couldn t i m just as depressed as everyone else but somehow i just keep trudging on\n",
            "very much relate i really don t know how much longer i ve got though i ve been falling asleep at my desk barely reading emails i don t reply to texts because i m too tired to think of how to respond i start school in two weeks and i have already considered just not showing up i wake up miserable fall asleep crying and or feeling lonely and think of killing myself every moment in between then i see someone and have to pretend to be chipper i don t know why i do this but i really am miserable no matter what i don t know how to be happy and it s getting harder to pretend i am too i really have just been thinking of laying in bed all day i just feel like i belong there\n",
            "it s rough i m tired of staring in the mirror into dead eyes fighting sleep so i don t have to go through another day of bullshit waking up and wishing it would end going through my day feeling so incredibly hollow i want to lay in bed but i can t the act must continue\n",
            "i haven t worked in five years because of my depression and anxiety i m not sick enough for disability but working pushed my physical and mental limits every single day it was always getting by hour by hour some days i would completely dissociate and people would notice getting out of bed felt like climbing a mountain of shards of glass with my bare feet i need to start working again and i don t think i can do it\n",
            "wow i just said almost the same thing to my psychologist recently it s like i don t really want to get out of bed i just have to my motivation to do anything is rarely positive it s almost all borne from anxiety or being chewed out by my mother i guess who thinks she s compassionate towards mental illness but quite clearly isn t when it s not someone saying they want to kill themselves or having a full blown panic attack i think that s one thing those that are saying we should be grateful we re not low functioning miss even if people weren t sympathetic they can at least see there s something wrong with you but if you re high functioning people think you re fine when you know you re not and it just feels so hopeless reaching out seems pointless because who except you worthless is it really going to help i wonder if it s the anxiety depression combination responsible for this kind of dysfunctional functioning it s an ongoing issue with me because i feel like i wouldn t get anything done if it weren t for the list of things i have to should be doing oh my god there s so many things why didn t you start this sooner also everything has to be perfect or you re garbage kind of thinking i could just stay in bed feeling bad but not in any motivated way the dysfunctional functioning doesn t feel sustainable but i can t figure out a way to stop it s like at some point i had to choose between fully feeling things and appearing normal and chose the latter without even realising because i couldn t ever process the idea of doing anything else\n",
            "that was me for a while until i finally said fuck it and gave up completely i go many nights now without brushing my teeth which cause part of my tooth to chip off i have pills but i don t take them consistently i work at 5am and stay up late because i don t want to get up i am so far gone from functioning normally and happily i don t know when i ll ever snap out of it\n",
            "i definitely did during my years of high functioning depression i was tired of having the severity of my misery dismissed by counselors i felt gaslit by my own mind i finally did reach the point of incapacitation and it was a huge relief it was what i had secretly desired all along in a way i m not saying the result was good but letting go of the daily grind of pushing through did come as a relief\n",
            "yes its amazing the things we can push ourselves to do when we feel the way we feel inside but that is the promise we have inside us if we can do this we can beat it and move forward one day like others have said there are many who are was worse off be thankful you can push through and get up and get out\n",
            "don t say you wish you hit rock bottom i am non functioning depressed hopeless helpless crap right now and hit rock bottom many times and why i haven t killed myself yet when i m a burden idk i wish i can take magical pills but none i just need work and finish my degree and also heartbreak makes me hopeless even when i m at work i was suicidal when i think of my love i can t have so mentally incapacitated i put off things i should have done if you hit rock bottom how else that will change how you feel about life\n",
            "i think a lot of use feel this way sometimes i think it has to do with what i am doing during the day even if i am doing something i like though its not always good i am sometimes doing it with a fake smile i think just accepting that i feel bad is always the best way to go even though its the hardest\n",
            "i feel the exact same it s exhausting having to put a fake smile on and act like you re okay when you know you re not\n",
            "weeeell if you are at the point of breaking i suppose luckily you are probably heading out of the high functioning state yeah it sucks\n",
            "right now yes i m in this stupid middle ground of i can get out of bed and take care of myself but i m struggling to do my normal workload i m super avoidant of my office i ve been getting intense anxiety enough to where i went to urgent care to make sure i wasn t having a heart attack i m middle functioning and it makes it look like i m freaking lazy\n",
            "big same on a daily basis all i feel is anger and resentment towards people who just go about living life i wish i could just lay in bed all day and never get up but instead i have to be like this\n",
            "fuck yes it s my first time in a while not being responsible i am currently on a trip and i spend 90 of my time in my hotel room and i like it and yesterday i was thinking i wish i could allow myself to be so vulnerable that i could stay in the psych ward for months i am not stronger than the average mentally ill person but guilt makes me do everything and even if i do need that psych ward really badly i can t afford to allow myself to let my guards down any longer after this trip i need a job i need to do everything i need to be doing and just hope that my next mental breakdown won t make me lose my job\n",
            "unfortunately i m not of the high functioning group i hit rock bottom frequently i can understand your desire for it because sometimes it just feels good in a way but just be prepared that it s a challenge to get out of and can be really scary at times it s definitely not a fun place to be try to remember your good habits and get back to them bit by bit you ll be okay\n",
            "yeah i m sick of it also because i feel like everyone looks at me and they think you re depressed because when i do allow myself to break it s like but you were fine\n",
            "yes the worst part is that no body believes you when you re high functioning they think that it s not that bad cuz you re still doing this and that i think high functioning people suffer more we suffer alone because people brush us off we re just over dramatic and no one believes us from the get go because they can t see that the person on the surface isnt happy or normal they can t see past the image we display not only is it lonely but it s exhausting as hell you spend all that energy making it look like you re ok and then have to go home and hate yourself alone until you re able to fall asleep sleep is my only safe haven\n",
            "i used to be low functioning and sometimes i honestly miss it people used to congratulate me for getting dressed now people report me to my boss if i don t look like a sears ad from the 1950 s fuck i miss hospital days\n",
            "all of this every goddamn day i feel like i m in terrible pain except i can t feel it and i still get up take a shower and drive to work screaming the whole way\n",
            "i really wear my heart on my sleeve it s obvious that i m not okay but i still get my shit done so i feel like people don t take me seriously\n",
            "you arent alone same here and thank you for showing me that i m not fake i always read these posts and think hmm well maybe i m not depressed i feel it thought and the worse part is i am open to talk with people that are willing to listen and they think im lying because i don t seem depressed i wish they could understand and better i wish they would help me\n",
            "yes 100 but at this point i m bed ridden because i have lung problems i hate my fucking life\n",
            "100 especially this part i m also sick of constantly feeling like i m about to break i m incredibly lucky i found meds that work for me but it doesn t mean they make me normal i m just hanging by a thread if i mop around all day and actually exhibit the symptoms of depression then some people would think that it s an attention seeking behaviour if i just pretend nothing is wrong people who know about my depression would probably think if it s real and things are particularly tough these days i don t exactly feel suicidal but i wish i could sleep for days without waking up or worrying about my job i just don t want to be conscious right now\n",
            "fucking yes when its a good day i m a working machine but it s usually only once a month that i have a really good day then it s mainly just eh ing it until the monthly breakdown that leaves me hopeless until the next month like i m really close to just saying everythings terrible my brain won t shut the fuck up my dick don t work from anti ds my career is stagnant my love life is hopeless i want to die but don t want to kill myself but i m too fucking broke to hire a hitman and too fucking lucky to get murdered that s what s up now either hug me talk to me or go away to the next person that asks how im doing\n",
            "holy shit yes i have certain days where i m non functional but overall i ve always been able to go about my day and do what needs to be done though i do let my hygiene and health slip occasionally it almost makes things that much more exhausting than if i was just at my worst all the time and i also feel like a goddamn faker most of the time i ll go from contemplating suicide one minute to telling myself i m just a whiner and i can t really be depressed if i m capable of getting up and going to class or taking a shower\n",
            "i cannot relate at all but i just wanted to say that for all the structural damage that v low functioning mental illness has done to my life being high functioning seems beyond horrific and so much worse being stuck in these emotional and cognitive states is plenty awful enough without also having to hide it and perform as if everything was ok add to that the fact that people with high functioning depression tend to be at much more risk partly because there is no release valve but also because it is so much harder to get support when so much of the world interprets functioning as doing ok and high functioning as doing great i wish i had some useful things to suggest but from my perspective suggestions for ways to develop psychological safety valves or even to learn ways to challenge harmful beliefs would do more harm than good and cause more pain if made in this context that sort of conversation necessitates knowing a person well and being able to monitor how they are doing rather than blurting out things on an anonymised forum i realise that may seem cowardly but it is more to do with not wanting to ride roughshod over your situations so because i can t do that in the most loving way possible i wish all of you a good breakdown and the means to obtain the care and self care that you all need\n",
            "yeah but recently it has been slipping into becoming non functional and i am really really scared\n",
            "i used to think that i don t really have depression and that i m just a whiny bitch i thought if i hit rock bottom then i d have a legitimate issue and they would finally give me the real meds and the real treatment obviously that s not true and sadly nothing can help me at this point whether i m functional or not\n",
            "i find myself thinking oh i know that feeling with each reply i read haha thanks to everyone who has posted it makes me relieved to know others feel the same way i do\n",
            "when my parents found out i was dealing with this and more one of the things they said was they never considered it because my performance in school has always been extremely good\n",
            "same i don t think i can do the normal adult thing anymore i wish i could move to a nice secluded spot somewhere and just be\n",
            "yes i daydream about letting go and losing my shit once and for all then i think of bills and my kids and keep going i just want to fall apart sometimes and it gets harder and harder to keep it together\n",
            "yes i hate knowing i can get out of bed tomorrow and that i will it makes me feel as though i m making it all up\n",
            "your depression is just that yours as we are all unique you can t just tell someone really it s like a puzzle that each of us goes day to day trying to solve it sucks and alot of times all you want is to hear read that someone else feels similar to you\n",

            "i look forward to being high functioning i look forward to the day that i have a place to go a schedule to keep someone to be accountable to because sitting in my chair calling myself a moron because i can t get the motivation to shower for the first time in five days really sucks\n",
            "i feel exactly the same sometimes i feel like i m able to improve my mental state by pushing myself to be fine and to function normally but at the back of my head in every single day i try to be okay to feel okay makes me so tired i m really really really tired of pushing myself every day i don t even aim to feel happy but even just to feel fine average i told a friend about this one time and he told me that maybe i should stop trying so hard i couldn t answer him back that i m scared to stop fighting if i do i m afraid i ll finally break and let myself go\n",

            "there s several times that i actually wish i could get sick so i could just take a break for bit\n",
            "i feel this it s part of having a hidden illness if only it showed on the outside\n",
            "it s not easy regardless of the level of functionality you have to try and cultivate some meaning for yourself for why you do it all for me it s because i m more afraid to die than i am to go on living like a normal person and that there are fleeting moments that i can experience where it is worth it to not just give in but you have to find your own meaning wish you the best stay strong\n",
            "i think i understand this instead of being able to pretend that i m functioning somewhat normally i would rather not be able to show up to work in the morning maybe i forget the route to the office building so i spend all day driving randomly through the city or maybe i forget to put on my pants in the morning soni have to drive home and take the day off i don t know\n",
            "yah and there is constant stress from the belief that people are going to figure it out\n",
            "dear god yes and even my doctor is very sweet and understanding and yet she gauges how serious my depression is by whether or not i can get to work like just because i m able to get to work doesn t mean that i don t wanna kill myself every single moment that i m out of my bed\n",
            "god i feel this you re so cheerful and bubbly i love your positivity if you only actually knew\n",
            "i just went to my primary doctor to talk about depression he didn t seem to take me seriously because i didn t seem sad in my head i was screaming because i ve been taking bird baths to wash my armpits in place of showers going straight from work to bed and skipping activities i love for months i just want to feel like myself again\n",
            "hi may i know how you deal with it how do you seek support i am done with saying i am okay or fine whenever people asking how am i and putting the most fake smile i can i just feel like i am going to break\n",
            "yes i call it the snap theory that snap can consist of going all out one day whether its sex suicide beating the shit of someone or what not and it sucks have to hold in every fucking day had to call in monday actually fuck i need an outlet but don t know what to do fml\n",
            "when we take the pill meds all at once in the morning they wear off by night and we feel a combination of sadness plus sundowners syndrome recognize it as a normal pattern and try to go to sleep earlier and maybe take your drugs a little later in the morning and see if that helps the later you stay up the more depressed and anxious you feel denying you what you really need calm peaceful sleep put on some white noise rain sounds make the bed perfect have a fan blowing learn to love sleep learn to tell your body and mind to let go it s okay to sleep let go of the pointless overthinking let go of the fear and sadness because sleep and treating yourself kindly are the answer one of the biggest contributors of depression and irrational thinking is sleep deprivation you are good enough the problems can all be fixed tomorrow just let go\n",
            "all the time and i m constantly overlooked when speaking about mental issues because i m not bedridden and ill looking just because i can get out of bed every day doesn t mean it s not still hard i too want to give in op it sucks\n",
            "i want to break i can t leave my job because i have a physical disability that requires a consistant income i just wish someone would talk to me anyone being disabled and depressed is so isolating\n",
            "i feel like the only reason i m high functioning is because my fear of disappointing others is usually stronger than my desire to just crawl under my bed and never come out usually college was a bitch\n",
            "yes but we live in this latestage capitalistic broken system and apparently everyone is supposed to be ok with it and should suck it up\n",
            "i feel this so much my high functioning depression is giving me hell right now i have gotten so good at pretending i m okay no one can see how much pain i m in and when i try to ask for help people don t realize just how close to the edge i am because i seem fine most of the time\n",
            "i honestly believe functioning us harder than not because when you re functioning you need to deal with the same things as everyone else but it s harder and you re also aware of whats wrong with you low functional and normal people have it so much easier and don t even know it\n",
            "i totally relate to this i cope well with part time work but any more and the cracks really show but i get comments like it s just a few extra hours what s the problem and it s like you don t get it i may be able to work and get out of bed and etc but it feels like i m constantly on edge of a breakdown the slightest thing can push me over that edge and then the freaking comments of but you were okay yesterday begins i wasn t okay but because everyone seems to have this picture of what a typically depressed person looks like urgh sorry rant over basically you re not alone in this being high functioning sometimes feels like a curse\n",
            "yep i m seen as the strong competent type when i do get overwhelmed the reaction is mostly how dare she we depend on her it confuses people because the image i project is caring and competent i totally understand about wishing you could hit rock bottom for me it s a type of longing to be taken care of for a change instead of always being the caretaker but yeah next day i get up get dressed and put on the brave face luckily for me the coping thing is almost automatic if that makes sense no real joy or enthusiasm but i get on with things because it s become a habit\n",
            "sweet jesus yes i remember a solid school year going by where it felt like that was just injected into my veins every day it felt like hell worst part is my dad can t believe it every time i ve opened up to him about what happened that year how i constantly felt like killing myself just to get off this boring painful ride he just can t believe it after all i had perfect grades and did all my chores well you get the point it s really the perfect lie and it sucks\n",
            "i usually just spend a day doing shit i wanna do by myself and just being myself seems to soothe the pain for a bit\n",
            "mine goes through highs and lows sometimes i m high functioning and others i just can t get out of bed i ve always been kind of stoic and really good at not showing emotions so most days i just truck on\n",
            "yup if you compared me to some people you wouldn t think i was suicidal at all but i smile sometimes and interact with people and am generally clean so i look like everyone else\n",
            "yeah i m sick of it too but that just how my life is i tried my best not to fall deep into depression pretending to be okay in front of people and try my best to keep myself going but doing this everyday can be tiring depression can be a bitch tho i tried to fix myself by going out more often do some exercise take a hobby but depression be like lol nice try gosh i wish i could just sleep all day not doing anything or shoot myself to death but that s not gonna happen i have bills to pay and work to do i m basically too weak to live and too weak to end my life anyway just keep going guys maybe someday we finally figured out on how to sort this shit out\n",
            "after years of being functioning and feeling like i was going to break i finally crashed i have stopped functioning at least now people realise i am not feeling too well\n",
            "i feel like i see saw between high functioning and low functioning sometimes i can go to work actually make small talk and even run errands afterwards if i m lucky i can cook dinner but most of the time i spend two hours convincing myself i need to go to work stay alone and quiet with the recurring negative thoughts then go home and pass out til the next day or just sit on my phone for hours i ve had that thought during work that i can t make it through and i need to check myself in asap and it ll circle in my brain til i m completely anxious and freaking out but then i never go to get help i have coverage to call into work due to another disorder i have so i ve found myself calling in more and more to the point it s like once or twice a week i say it s cuz of the disorder when really i don t have the mental strength to make it through the day\n",
            "god i agree i haven t been diagnosed but i m fairly sure this is me i don t want to open up because i don t want to bring you down i feel bad i hate myself everyday for it yes i can get up but barely how are you oh yk barely meeting the basic expectations of a human being blinking and breathing and all that\n",
            "i gave up kinda hit rock botto realized that the problem isn t me but that fucked up system feel better now also smoke weed just not too much and eat before smoking always\n",
            "had a fantasy of going to rehab the other day and i don t use drugs i d just like the break\n",
            "yep i pull off enough of a front to get by but the cost is my sanity i want to say fuck it and quit the daily grind bullshit but i can t imagine being able to convince a judge that yes i hold a job but no it s not healthy and not sustainable for me in the long term\n",
            "you are definitely not alone in these feelings i sometimes feel like people i open up to about my feelings don t take me seriously because i m still functioning it is exhausting but all we can do is our best\n",
            "yeah and it sucks really bad when the depression is caused by our world collapsing and i cant stop thinking about the ineveitable death of all of us thus i cant enjoy anything\n",
            "don t want to sound invalidating bcus the feelings you have feels like you constantly know you can snap at any second but pls be grateful that you re high functioning my depression led me to have outbursts at school which landed me in in school suspension i have never been in trouble at school in my whole life and it made it hard for me to have a good reputation you think that if you break you will feel free but you ll feel more stuck than ever but besides that pls reach out to someone to notify that you feel this way i know it sounds like generic advice but i really want someone to be there to understand how you re feeling rn\n",
            "i ve been so depressed lately that i quit my job and my dad is making a bigger deal out of it than it is\n",
            "i sure don t feel high functioning but in comparison to many other people then i guess i am hey check out my website depression2perspectiveshealth blog i m school psychologist and struggling with mdd anxiety borderline personality disorder and ptsd for 34 years my goal is to support inform and share with others\n",
            "it s weird because i fluctuate so frequently most days i m okay i don t really wanna do anything though i ll put off going to the store for weeks if i can i just have no energy to do it i d rather not eat than get off the couch to go buy food but i still get up every morning i still make sure to wash my hair and change my clothes only because others will judge me if i don t in reality i don t care about being dirty but then there are mornings where i just wake up and i start bawling my eyes out and go straight for bottle or whatever drug i have on hand at least with those days it s easy to just be able to say i m depressed and everyone will understand even if they don t like me for it seeing as most people tell me to just stop being depressed like i have a choice but being high functioning is hard to explain at least in why i hate it so much the only times i tried to kill myself was when i was low functioning but it s like being high functioning means i m just this lazy asshole all the time because i don t wanna do anything or be around anyone because i can t handle it i m so sick of all of it\n",
            "this i just want to call in today and take a mental health day but i can t because i feel the fucking need to be high functioning and reliable even though i desperately need today to myself\n",
            "i find it especially hard when sharing in groups for alcoholics i quit drinking and thus started following those groups for support when i m having a rough time i get handed a lot of judgement for not being in aa and working my program right they don t understand that my depression is not the result of my addiction but it s actually the other way around my addictions are a symptom of my depression when my depression is under control i have no need for using and no desire to i don t drink primarily because it drives my depression out of control\n",
            "i hate how my strength and resolve and resiliency to keep going when i am in so much pain while others stop and draw down is actually a detriment to my treatment and assessment since i am not taken as seriously ill as i really am since some of their scales rely on how functional you are like i d be better off if i was weaker it s such bs\n",
            "i m barely keeping up appearances lately and faking it at work is getting too hard i feel you the i definitely don t want to have a breakdown but also i need it to release the pressure and maybe get me some time off to recover is very real\n",
            "i was just talking about this it s like everyone forgot i m struggling bc i m finally getting some scheduling and prioritizing done i m a fucking mom now i have to i want to lay in bed all day i really do but no i can t i have to get up and do 10 000 things and wtf it s like noone notices sick of it\n",
            "yes because it makes it feel like my issues are not valid that no one would believe nor accept that fact that i am not well i also feel like garbage when i have days that i cannot do anything which has been increasing lately imagine feeling guilty for being unproductive when you have a valid reason for it but then you are high functioning so it is really an excuse\n",
            "i feel like i m on autopilot im just going through the motions even when technically i m not its compounded by the fact that my memory is shot so i ll be doing something and not remeber how i got there or feel disconnected from what i had done that day it s like everything is a dream really strange feeling\n",
            "yes this describes exactly how i feel i feel like i m going to break everyday but i will also say it is a blessing to get through the day\n",
            "1000 times yes i could have written this word for word functional depression is its own personal hell i feel like i m on the verge of a complete mental break down all the time yet i never quite reach that point my body manages to go on while my mind is against it it wants to see me fail cause me pain remain hopeless etc i can t stand going to work i dread it i loathe it while i m there constantly on edge and irritable what pisses me off the most is when customers tell me to smile they can fuck off i ve had break down after break down there just had another last sunday the manager i ended up breaking down in front of had me speak to my stores security team because i told her i d rather be dead i know stupid thing to admit i realized what i had done right away i knew i d have to stress over and over that i do not have a plan and i had to do just that they talked to me for maybe a half hour telling me life was worth it and i just need to want to get better and get help etc i go to work because i have to i have no other choice i have rent and other bills a part of me just wants to hit complete rock bottom so i can finally kill myself so yes i can drag myself out of bed to go to work i can brush my teeth in the mornings i can style my hair put on makeup get dressed but inside i m just not quite sure how to get through life my mind has given up why can t my body follow suit\n",
            "everyday i am constantly showing how well i am at being feeling like shit then i have a angry face and no one talks to you or just talk to show sympathy i have accepted loneliness but i still try to act like i am like them when in reality all i have is my self harming thoughts and end up running away finally the day is coming to it s end i smoke a joint to relax and psych the fuck up how about they are so little caring\n",
            "i wake up i go to work i try to be social and smile and joke with my coworkers for most of the day while i m distracted my feelings of depression are alleviated but they re still there then there s those moments throughout the day where i m not talking to people or have a moment to myself i can feel myself drop the act that i feel like i ve been putting on i feel like i m fighting and pushing away my depression all day and it s exhausting i go home and let myself sink into that dark and familiar place i hate going there but there s something comforting about it it doesn t feel like i m going uphill anymore when i m there i don t have to fight after acting all day it s in that moment where i feel like i can finally stop and be myself as fucked up as that sounds\n",
            "i think these sort of people have stigmitized depression to be popular oh no you were unable to put any sugar in your coffee or oh no my car broke down and i have to ride the bus today and now im depressed depression why dont you all try im not going to go outside today because im smart enough to realize my life is over but im not smart enough to get a job depression yet society was apparently setup for people who were never gifted contradictions everywhere edited grammar\n",
            "yessssssss i want someone to notice how much i m hurting but as long as im functioning no one suspects anything\n",

            "i know you don t want to hear this and that it s probably been said to you over and over again in a condescending manner by those who ve never actually experienced depression but sleep exercise nature it s so irritating to hear i know i hated and railed against it whenever someone would say it to me at my worst which was very bad but i m in remission now i know that if i let myself get sedentary or socially isolated or too obsessed with the screen to fall asleep i will go back to drinking myself numb sleeping all day doing laundry 1x a month and showering 2x a week if that you re so close all i had was that i could show up to work and maintain a relationship but i realize now i was barely doing both\n",
            "while all mental illnesses are difficult if you re high functioning you should be greatful you re able to go to work you re able to take care of yourself you can function and fit in to the normal society low functioning people can t do these things making life a hell of a lot more difficult\n",
            "no you shouldn t fucking wish to hit rock bottom everyone with depression feels like they re about to break being high functioning is a blessing in the curse that is depression when you see someone who has hair so matted it can t move teeth so rotten they all have to be pulled a person so weak because they don t eat move or sleep you won t be mad about being high functioning again like i m sorry you re depressed most of us here are and we all know it s hard as hell but wow\n",

            "i had a breakdown at my local coffee shop and the ladies were so nice it was a shitstorm of car issues and big work things and then another unexpected big expense once the rush cleared out they offered to help and i accepted a small coffee for the road when i left their kindness really helped me get through that awful day i was back in last weekend and they were both working again so i was able to thank them without sobbing uncontrollably\n",
            "i did the exact same and it s helped me a ton i don t exactly socialise just sit on my computer but it feels great enough to just be around other people in this comfy environment\n",
            "i become a regular at a local diner when i was going through a breakup day after day when i get out of work i would go in have my usual food and coffee sit in the same spot i later started to have a regular waitress as well started to get to know everyone the sense of feeling when you walk in and have all these people say hi and say your name is such a great mood booster\n",
            "likewise i like being a regular and being pleasantly greeted even if it s their jobs at several coffee shops in town but just maintaining this routine of grabbing coffee alone or with a friend kind of kept me from wallowing away if i stuck to something consistent i d be okay or maybe it was my coffee addiction or both but it was a positive and has always remained one to keep me going lately the little things matter\n",
            "i m a regular at a local subway and even if i don t stop by for long it really is nice that people recognize your face good on you op\n",
            "as a barista and someone with mental illness i hope my efforts to remember names and coffee orders offer some small amount of happiness like in your case\n",
            "this is why i buy coffee at a coffee shop yes karen i know i can save 800 yr if i brew my own at home but then i ll end up spending that 800 yr and more on hospitalization after i attempt to kill myself from all the isolation i work from home and sometimes the only face to face interaction i get is at the coffee shop people who shame others for getting a few lattes a week should shut it\n",
            "i found myself smiling through this post i relate so much to this especially when i was in college my second batch of friends ended up being a fake one again and took away my one genuine friend with them needless to say i was super happy whenever i visit the coffee shop i m a regular at and i could be friendly or be myself whenever i wanted without being judged sometimes i d be shy and quiet and that s okay other times i m chatty and upbeat and that s also okay it s not better nor less and i just really love that even though i found a new smaller set of genuine friends nothing replaces the comfort i get of being me i don t force myself to talk and be upbeat at all so i m glad you got through your dark days and are getting better now a cup of coffee or any drink you prefer can actually make a difference thank you for sharing your story it cheered me up again\n",
            "i live in a rural town in the southeast and am not near a coffee shop but i know exactly what you re talking about there s a gas station with a restaurant in it where a lot of guys around here escape the house and go hangout becoming a regular there even if no one is there and it s just the clerk has definitely taken me from some dark places\n",

            "hmm i m curious if you started conversation or if people came up to you i m constantly ignored and it seems like my presence isn t noticed by anyone so i m curious how you were able to join a community i go to a gym everyday and play basketball yet no one wants to play even when i ask i like to think being social would help but i ve failed in that department of my life since no one really gives a shit about me so yeah i m really curious on how you were able to be a part of a community\n",
            "i am so happy for you that you found community and someplace to go that makes you happy\n",
            "that s nice i used to be a regular at this one starbucks though i didn t talk to anyone staying there for hours while i drank coffee smoked cigs and read books was really therapeutic for me i love coffee shops\n",
            "i did something similar recently as a depressed person i went out to a local restaurant by myself which i never do because of my vision problems but while i was there alone for a change i felt less depressed just because there were people around then someone i normally go out to eat with just happened to show up anyway\n",

            "i wish i could find the right coffee shop i only stop by at starbucks or costa for a coffee to go but i wouldn t stay it s always too crowded and noisy\n",
            "i wish this could happen to me when i visit my local library to read my city is full of people who don t like to talk to strangers everyone is so stressed out it s prob the reason why my depression may be sociological i grew up in a town where life is seen as all about school to college then work all day till death with a family you have to follow the norm to pursue a degree in a high demanding category like medical in order to feel successful i was miserable at college as i found nothing after years of discovering that struggle only pushed me to the edge of suicide my willpower to just live life doing what i love while not giving a shit about anyone who sees me as a failure my family and co workers i only have an interest in musical arts and nature all i do is work part time in a job i absolutely hate but so hard to get into another job while playing my violin and taking nature walks listening to my favorite music tracks in my spare time once i reach to that point where i am kicked out of the house ill just use all my saved up money and go on my bucket list and just end it right there i don t want to live in thks pursuit of the american dream which is nothing to me\n",

            "i ve never thought about this before i guess me and my laptop will be visiting a local coffee shop this weekend\n",
            "you know this is really brilliant i ve always told people that coffee shops are a totally underrated place to hang out a lot of times especially local coffee shops really value repeat business and are better at making you feel like you re not just a nameless faceless person i m so glad you found a sense of community and people you feel comfortable around hugs\n",
            "i m feeling depressed right now and school is a factor and i was thinking of getting coffee now i know that s what i m doing thank you i m glad you found such an awesome community\n",
            "i couldn t agree more i just love being around people meeting people or unexpectedly seeing people i know and the vibes i get from my coffee shop plus its a great way to force myself out of my depression hole and into a positive and productive mindset\n",
            "great idea thank you for sharing this i am going to try it out since i love coffee and have lots of homework i m glad it helps you\n",
            "wish that worked for everyone nice is all i was to everyone but all i get is shunned and spat on so sick of being treated like i m not human to the point i may as well not bother acting like it never been accepted in any community and no one ever will so what s the point for some piece of shit like me congrats to you tho happy for you\n",

            "i m quite the opposite to be honest i tried to do my assignment at the coffee shop i went and most of the people there are so loud especially when they laugh most of the coffee shops in my country is expensive af so sad\n",
            "great really great i hope i can find my place love atmosphere in cafe s too\n",
            "don t believe them they might be some cannibalistic people tryna eat you run man they can t smell you from distance\n",
            "you can say exactly that but if you don t feel comfortable with writing that to people irl you can always try something like i m sorry i have read your messages but cannot reply right now because i m not feeling well i am not ignoring you but i also want to be able to reply to you properly and in a clear way and for that i need some time or something along those lines\n",
            "i have been feeling like for about 2 years now it is really hard to explain to someone this because they don t understand i am looking for an answer as well\n",
            "exactly what you wrote if you can write it on here you can tell that person if they act offended eff em\n",
            "an actor i don t want to see any of my friends or family i watch my phone ring all day and play video games movies to distract myself sometimes i think i m heartless because i don t feel anything being disconnected sucks and it s not worth explaining because no one will understand they ll just listen i also have a hard time with the days of the week and the number on the month it s all the same shit don t want to talk but everyone gets angry when i don t contact them back sorry i don t have any real advice though just thought i d relate\n",
            "exactly that i am on the opposite side with a friend who hasn t replied to a single message or phone call in 2 months a friend of a friend spoke to them on christmas day so i have a vague idea of what s happening it s hard i also suffer from anxiety and depression and some days i just think maybe they wanted to cut me out of their life i don t know at this point but i know they re very unwell so i hope some day i ll get this text back\n",
            "you can say just that if that s how you feel whoever it is should hopefully understand and respect that keep strong you ve got this oki but if you want different ways to say it i wrote out a few down here that i ve used in the past which ya ll can mess with and alter to your needs i m sorry i ve been unable to reply everything is a blur and i struggle to keep engaged with things you haven t done anything wrong it s just a lot going on right now and i m sorry i m sorry if it feels like i ve been ignoring you i don t want to it s just that lately it s been really hard to keep focused on anything even the days all kind of blend together i just feel numbness and keeping contact is draining sorry i m not trying to ignore you i ve just been feeling a disconnect from everything and i struggle to feel emotions a lot of the times trying to keep conversations drains my energy a lot and i don t want to give distant replies to you i m sorry they aren t much and they re all kind of the same but if they can help in any way i hope they come in handy much loves to all of you\n",
            "just say it as straight as possible to them i would t get mad or offended and i believe anyone with the slightest bit of understanding wouldn t either but if they do take it personally it is not your fault your feelings and your situation should matter to the people in your life\n",
            "tell them that and they ll never leave you alone just say you re working on yourself and you need space for a bit\n",
            "fuck i lost a lot of friends doing this don t hate them just don t feel like talking i hate the way it ended the relationship\n",
            "i m in this exact situation right now i try to explain myself in the best way possible without giving away too much personal details and no one seems to understand they haven t personally ever dealt with it so their immediate response is just be happy then it s exhausting having to let everyone know that it s not them it s me and have them understand and respect it\n",
            "you can say something like if i send you the spoon emoji im not in a place where i can wanna talk just know that im not ignoring you\n",
            "as someone who dated someone that went through a similar feeling and ended up ghosting me i can definitely say i would have preferred the text sure it may be uncomfortable but it s the respectful thing to do you also don t want to waste anyone s time so just be honest and you don t even have to go into details or read the reply just give people the chance to let you go and give you and themselves what s needed i spend everyday worrying about where he went and why he left and if his mental physical state is ok which in turn caused me even more depression an anxiety i m sorry you re going through a lot but just try not to hurt others in the process by ghosting or being dishonest goodluck\n",
            "just say exactly that and if it isn t someone that you re particularly close to but still care about say that you ve been disconnected lately and still are but wanted to remind that person that you care about them haven t forgotten them i m in the same situation so i say go for it i took the plunge a couple of months ago and texted a friend telling them i missed them and that i had disappeared because i was struggling with myself and they responded with so much enthusiasm and love that i felt silly for thinking that they would care either way i admire that you want to show your friends that you care and that you still think of them when you re going through a hard time\n",
            "everyone that has ever been worth having in my life would completely understand if you sent exactly this if they don t they aren t worth having in your life\n",
            "well i understand that it may be hard to say what you wrote in the title to someone when you re so exhausted and numb as you describe you don t wanna talk so you don t want to say anything to them because you can t deal with that right now and if you do honestly say what s going on they might start asking more questions become worried about you etc and that s also not helpful for you at the moment this is really a difficult situation one i find myself in many times i usually just fake it and act like nothing s wrong let them hear what they want to hear tell them i m fine but just really tired and need some rest then they leave me alone quicker and i can have some respite takes a lot of effort though this may not be healthy and helpful advice i m sorry it s all i know to do in these kind of situations\n",
            "i think you just can t for me whatever you tell them they ll think you could have used that message to reply to them instead of replying to say you will not reply anymore i usually ghost everyone and feel guilt and shitty about it but i mean i m already crying what s one more reason to do it but then again i haven t replied to anyone in the past 7 months because of my usual down period it never lasted this long don t know how to act so i would not recommend following anything i say\n",
            "i would recommend not saying that to people that are not depressed since they tend to misunderstand it a couple of years ago i was invited to a new house party of a friend of mine guess who lost contact with that friend when i told them something along the lines of this week has been very hard for me at work and personally so i decided to stay at home for the night and read some books to help me calm down a bit i hope you understand let me translate to you what i imagine he heard judging by his change of treatment towards me afterwards yo dude i have better things to do than to go to that party of yours i am telling you i am staying at home reading books to rest from a bad week because i want to make a victim out of myself i could have gone to that party of yours because you are so awesome that took the time to prepare the party for the whole group to have fun but i do not appreciate your efforts enough to just drag my lazy ass there sniff you around\n",
            "i just try to tell also thought about sending all of my friends just a postcard telling them i appreciate them and think about them but just need way mor etime alone i didn t do that but wrote some and informed them it s also good for myself takes away quite some pressure and is yeah also just fair some people told me they were hurt and thought i didn t like them and that once again opened my eyes that i don t want to hurt good people\n",
            "this i really want to tell my friends and family when i don t feel up to texting or calling but i feel they d think it s a lame excuse\n",
            "exactly like that i m so sorry i just lost someone who didn t tell me this i thought they were ignoring me they ll understand they probably love you they care enough to care if that makes sense please trust that any explanation is better than silence\n",
            "fake it text them hi make small talk be courteous in your responses when they ask why are you so distance or disconnect say you got a lot on your mind it s important that you don t lose your bond with love ones friends on the road to recovery you will benefit from a support group if you don t feel comfortable talking to them right now let them know you value your connection with them but it s important for you to process what s in your head make a list of things people that should be important to you and even if you feel numb take small steps to strengthen those connections bonds try to find something that gets you motivated no matter how trivial it may be playing multiplayer video games draw flowers or draw your pet cooking a new dish baking a strawberry cheese cake try something new try anything and everything anything to get that spark to care i m writing to my past self here but my hope is that you take steps not to lose your love ones\n",
            "i m in this kind of situation for a year now and i don t know will i be able to talk to those people again i feel terrible scared and just bad i don t know how to open up again what if they hate me of think that i did this because i don t like them anymore it s scary i don t have the balls to writ first after a year\n",
            "how do you do this at work how can i tell people i m depressed so they give me breathing room while also remaining professional and not lose my job\n",
            "you say what you just said i have my best friend from childhood we lost contact for over 20 years when we reconnected was always inviting me to go do things with her it is so very nice to be invited but i didn t want her to feel like i m pushing her away or just don t want her as a friend so i explained my struggles with motivation want to i told her i love her i m grateful for the invitations but i just can t right now she actually understood reassured me that she s always there for me when i do feel like doing something she s game soy advice is just be honest true friends and loving family will support you\n",
            "i hate the fact that i can t really help you but i can tell you that most likely unless that particular person has actually gone trough depression him herself it s difficult for them to ever understand what you are going through all you can do is try and be understanding of them and know that whatever their reaction they don t mean to hurt you it s fucking hard i know i wish i was that chill and mature but i end up angry and alienated lol c\n",
            "for someone that struggles with that it s better to know that the other person is going through something instead of getting ghosted who knows the other person might show understanding or even help you someway\n",
            "and now i m crying at work because you spoke the words that are in my heart\n",
            "i wish i could just broadcast this the world rn i havent been responding to anyone\n",
            "i m going to second that exactly what you wrote in the title will serve hope things get better\n",
            "i go through this too i have this one friend who texts me evens single day it gets really hard sometimes because i feel like i have to respond and text every single day what i do is i don t reply fast it may take me hours to respond and i try to give myself space i do tell this person you know i was sleeping or i m not feeling good i think maybe try that like give your self space from your friends and tell them how you re really feeling right now the world is a mess so they should understand\n",
            "exactly like that 3 or if you wanna go into less detail say that you re going through a rough patch and that socialising is very difficult at the moment\n",
            "well you could just tell them what you told us that seems like a logical explanation of how your feeling\n",
            "just telling someone you need some space is perfectly fine if you are in a conversation and someone accuses you of of listening just say something like sorry i have a lot on my mind right now as i can t see to focus on much else most people will have been in a similar spot and understand so they will leave you alone\n",
            "echoing the just use the words you used here advice but also we have the perfect excuse right now everyone is depressed because of covid lockdown so if you need to deflect or prefer brevity you can always blame it on pandemic brain i ve prefaced a lot of messages with sorry for the late reply lol what even is time these days and it s usually met with a lol mood or some similar commiseration being able to relate to depression making time slip away is super mainstream right now use that to your advantage\n",
            "thank you for sharing your situation by asking this question i feel less alone as i too am struggling with this\n",
            "i tell them i promise i m not ignoring you but i m having a hard time right now i ll reach out when i m ready i love and appreciate you\n",
            "i m not mentally here is what i normally say like how most people refer to i may be here physically but not mentally if they ask for more info i just say i literally just can t process anything at the moment\n",
            "i ghosted my dad a few years back and it doesn t help when i m trying to sleep forgot all contact info but i plan to visit eventually\n",
            "i m right there now too in like this empty kind of neutral don t feel like talking just want to fade away into the background everyone can forget me like they have already\n",
            "that s a damn good explanation would a person that hasn t experienced appreciate that explanation maybe not but at least it s the truth\n",
            "i just want to disappear or be alone for as long as i need is that too selfish to ask\n",
            "send memes about it but like don t respond with text when they respond just emojis throw in hearts so they know you still care about em at least that s what i do\n",
            "let me tell you you are not the only one this days after work i just lay on bed for hours being over curious about my life ignore all calls messages even those important one i feel exhausted with any form of conversation i know i am depressed but don t want to spend for psychiatric treatment as it s expensive in my country and some are scammer i fear it will worsen and break my belief system\n",
            "i think the fact you typed this out already shows that you can tell someone this perhaps they won t quite understand perhaps they won t accept it but as long as you tell them this i m sure things will be alright stay safe op\n",
            "as the top comment said being straightforward about it is the way to go sure you will still receive resistance but a real friend or someone who cares about you will understand and will not resent you for it if the person does resent you for it it s time to rethink that relationship\n",
            "just like everything else in life there s no other way to do it than just doing it literally copy and paste your title starting after the ellipsis and paste it to them that way they ll get the message without you having to think about it too much if you re scared of the response don t even look at it for a week that won t be blanking because you told them you re state of mind already\n",
            "just like that type it out and hit send before you have a chance to change your mind\n",
            "i d say i m not ignoring you right now i m just disconnected from reality right now the days are all blurred together and i feel completely numb towards everything around me so it s really hard for me to maintain a conversation\n",
            "id rather just get that text i recently had to confront an old friend with her repeated shitty behavior and she apologized i asked her if she s going to do something about it because we keep ending up in this situation and she ghosted me 9 days ago she s probably going through her own stuff but i m tired of making excuses having the benefit of the doubt for other people s shitty behavior id rather someone just be honest and upfront with me\n",
            "i feel ya a concise closed statement one that does not invite follow up conversation would be good essentially what you said minus the first sentence is great\n",
            "i think you should say it one tough thing to do though make sure they know that it s not them and your friendship isn t falling out i just say that i m tired and need to sort out things in my head i m not ashamed by it people leave sometimes because you seem jnstable or sad even distracted i really hope awareness is a bit higher nowadays\n",
            "this is exactly how i feel right now it s nice to know that i m not alone\n",
            "it s been years since i ve texted my old group of friends still don t feel like it\n",
            "damn that s been me for the last 7 years didn t even realize it was depression for years because i don t feel sad i tend to just tell people i m going through some things and just need time but it s been going on so long that inevitably people just give up and move on\n",
            "that sounded perfect and realistic to me i can completely relate and while it might be hard to open up and text or email those words their honesty will speak volumes\n",
            "honestly just that what you wrote is enough fyi at some point of their our life they we felt that way or needed that im sure to the person you will send it too will understand\n",
            "i always say it s not personal i will be okay i just need alone time for a while i will be in touch when i feel better which could be days weeks months years or never\n",
            "not gunna lie i ve just copied and pasted everything after how do you tell someone to my friends i dont think theres a better way to say it\n",
            "i m so bad at keeping up friendships cause i m just terrible at communicating with people i don t mind talking to people i m just very forgetful and love to be alone i ve been trying to keep up with texting a few cousins and friends for the past few months but everyone is so busy now all 4 of the people i chose to try to text me are married and 2 of em have kids although i m naturally and introvert i became less shy as i became an adult and i feel like i could talk to anyone but my memory is just so bad that i feel like someone people think i m ignoring them right now i have a really good friend who has similar issues with texting and memory we mostly just text about video games before the pandemic i d see him often usually to play video games or grab a bite to eat\n",
            "you can t and i ve learned expecting them to understand is unfair while them not understanding is quite unfair as well destroyed my 20 year marriage i m currently trying to fix acceptance is paramount on the part of both parties involved some things just can t be explained edit cos sausage fingers and mobile blows\n",
            "well that s a lot better than i usually say it so i d say just like that\n",
            "i have a friend who s currently going through this and we ve had a lot of conversations about it you just tell them exactly what you re thinking and if they can t accept you need space then they aren t a friend\n",
            "say exactly this i was going through this recently off and on some people get offended but whatever its for your health not theirs\n",
            "if they know you they ll understand my friend has these moments too and i know why sometimes she ll make a status to notify everyone after a while\n",
            "i usually say i m not really feeling myself this week i hope you understand i think even those that don t suffer from depression can relate to feeling off\n",
            "i don t really talk to anyone since my dog died 18months ago iv just let my health problems take over and stopped talking to people hiding the struggle\n",

            "in my own experience is to be direct not condescending not just disconnected but explain in a simple manor tell them look i understand you re going through what you re going through but i am also and i m probably not the one to be talking about this you can get 1 out of 2 responses the first your an ass hole in which you say you may feel that way but you not understanding makes you come across as an asshole too now we can sit down and discuss this what me and you are going through might not mean anything to eachother but if you can take the time to listen to me i ll be able to take the time to listen to you and go from there the other is they ll ask you whats up and when they ask that dont shut em down they took the time to confide in you the least you can do is confide in them they trust you enough to tell you whats urging them the least you can do is tell them whats on your mind\n",

            "can you explain blurred together it sounds like my time right now but don t know if you meant that what i think\n",

            "i ve struggled with depression my entire adult life i have beaten it at times but only when i do a half dozen things right at the same time but even then its a very fragile emotional state and i can easily sink back into depression if something goes wrong i take the wrong supplement i can t do all the stuff that helps me something traumatic happens in my life i lose my job there is a family fight etc i feel like depression is my natural state but if i do a bunch of things right at the same time i can find an island of relative emotional health but its a very fragile island it sucks also things like depression are tied into childhood trauma and people who have never experienced those will never understand it childhood trauma and genetics\n",

            "i don t know what you re going through but i hope you can get the help you need i m not gonna recommend anything just cause i m probably not much better than those people in terms of advice but just know people care about you and are rooting for you to get better 3\n",
            "i ve gone through a bit with how much my depression has fucked up my life and how hard i ve worked to get myself somewhere stable a big aspect of improving things came from finding the strength within myself to make things better it doesn t work for everyone it s not easy it takes determination it also is something people hope and wish you will do easily when it s never that simple i wish you the best op\n",
            "i hate all of the above quotes i ve been told all of them and this gem just get over it i have clinical depression have had since i was first put on meds when i was around 11 or so i ve been on meds ever since i also have other mental illness it is not as easy as just get over it or just stay positive absolute bullshit i struggle every day still\n",
            "my family enrages me when they say this to me they ll hit me with some bullshit like you ll be happy when you re productive you find a job you love spoken like true boomers who re happy to be wage slaves they re entire lives im sorry i want a little more for myself than to feed into some millionaires system of wealth generation\n",

            "what really gets me is the religious type that have never experienced depression like my parents who tell people to just pray about it and my favorite was that i was possessed by demons when i couldn t get out of bed for two weeks a few days later i tried to kill myself after two weeks of praying crying for hours every night for zombie jeebus to take the pain away then when i was being admitted into a psychiatric institution my mom had the audacity to ask my case worker if i could just go to church instead thankfully my caseworker said no and threaten to call dcfs for medical neglect if my mom didn t sign the papers to send me to get treatment i was 16 at the time\n",
            "the thing is that people who have had depression wont even bother to tell you how to get better because they know how it feels felt when others were trying to help them pointless they ve been through people constantly talking to them what how they should be doing something to get better which in rare ocassions helps so they dont wanna be one of those guys they themselves perceived more as an additional burden rather than actual help so you are often left with well intentioned people who might ve been through a sad phase but confuse this with depression which the origin from cant even be traced down by the people suffering from it themselves curing sadness or curing depression is a whole different game\n",
            "i have been overthinking everything i do and everything that happen and then somehow normal people doesn t really give a shit and lives their life carefree like how can their minds do that\n",
            "i ve learned to accept that people will try to help you even if they don t know anything about the situation you are in i mean you can t blame people for not knowing what undergoing a depression feels like but trying to help you anyway sure it s annoying but that frustration leads to nothing maybe if there would be more awareness concerning depressions people would understand maybe in a few more years or so it s gotten better lately people will always try to show that they care few know how to do it correctly and that s ok best of luck to you\n",
            "a personal favorite is just be grateful yes i m grateful for my bpd that makes every moment complete torment i so grateful that my husband had a massive stroke and is now a shell of what he was i m so grateful not to have any family of my own because they re too toxic to be around very grateful that my in laws never stop judging me and talking shit behind my back so grateful that we re poor as shit and everything s a struggle another one is oh stop it if i tell anyone that i m suicidal so grateful for that amazing advice\n",
            "i get told these things by people and what i tell them back think it s okay to love yourself and can t you just love you um i don t know how to love myself and i hate myself as well too if you kill yourself everyone will hate you forever whatever floats their boats i guess and i highly doubt that some of them would or not things will get better i hate whenever someone tells me this because they simply are guessing and don t really know meaning in other words they don t know how my depression is like things don t just become better i wish that many would understand when you die you better make sure that you were a mistake whatever and thank you for the kind death sentencing words it means a lot i will make sure to make a trip visit to haunt you and lastly from someone that i do not know at all stay away from my children you fucking bitch and your psychotic craziness you should rot in hell and die who are you and no obviously not the crazy one here it s you you were coming at me and that s uncalled for though thank you for telling me to die and rot in hell this made me spiral with anxiety and my depression had gone horribly i unfortunately become triggered by certain words and sometimes phrases as well it s moreso like people forget that i am a human being with emotions and i am very sensitive however some know that i am clinically diagnosed and they don t care so therefore i suffer a lot\n",
            "i was just told that i m lazy because i won t clean my room or don t want to do anything but sleep depression can affect a person in so many different ways i also hate when people say you shouldn t be sad someone else is going through worse then you just be grateful\n",

            "my absolute favorite is the just think about the positives the whole point is that this is a mental disorder that i cant cure by just thinking differently\n",
            "i never met anyone in my life who has never experienced some sort of depression or anxiety of course it s on a spectrum but if people don t know how to address it it s just a lack of empathy\n",

            "everyone s an expert and they don t have the slightest clue about how depression works or is different for everyone suffering from it\n",
            "the most frustrating part is they re not listening they can t fathom that someone would experience something outside of their own personal experiences so they just shut you down with simple fix its that they assume would work for them\n",
            "i have someone who tells me it s my diet i ve always eaten healthy lots of veggies not even a little overweight but they insist that if i just committed to a keto diet and supplements then my depression would magically get better nevermind that i have a congenital heart defect which those keto diets can make a lot worse my depression didn t manifest until i lost my twin brother that keto diet gonna bring him back to life because that s the only thing that s gonna make this better\n",
            "i think it s because people have a very minimalistic perception of depression in general and most of them assume that it s just means being sad when it s a huge misunderstanding whenever others tell me to cheer up it really destructs me from the inside and they are consistently undermining what it actually it and that actually makes me feel less valid because they just don t comprehend how this illness is affecting my life and sometimes even my ability to function properly but those individuals have probably never encountered a depressive episode and are only associated with the feeling of being sad which is a conventional thing that everyone is going through but the media has also persuaded others into thinking that being depressed is an edgy and remarkable thing which immediately makes it trendy too it s like depression isn t a prominent thing anymore and that makes it even more challenging to go through because no one fully understands your condition and that makes it more inconvenient for the ones that are actually coping with it\n",
            "i feel it s because people try to relate not understanding what the depressed person is really feeling many think depression is being sad it s not it s torture in the form of knowing you should feel something and wanting to but just not being able to do so i think they don t even consider things like this happen that said i m sorry you had to hear this shitty kind of advice it s only one step above have you tried being happy like gee i haven t thought about that the only thing that had some effect for me was people close to me constantly showing they love me even if i fail to love myself it didn t help on it s own i had medication and it s still work in progress but it was surely much more meaningful than the blatant just enjoy life\n",
            "i had my primary care doctor old lady say to me 2 months ago you should be grateful after she asked me how i was doing because she knew i was depressed when she said that i shut up for the rest of the visit cried only shook my head to just get that visit over with she spent 30 minutes instead of going over the normal physical stuff just to tell me to be grateful you have a job you should be happy not alot of people have a job or insurance she said other insulting things but i d rather not go into it for the end visit notes and summary she put needs to learn gratitude everytime i think that s in my file for that visit i feel terrible imediantly got a different doctor he told me her attitude towards me was not acceptable sadly my therapist was going through back surgery and i waited 2 months for his recovery and i m seeing him again next week i m going to tell him what happened because he knows how hard my life and job is he said so himself that alot of his patients come from my job since i work in a big place and his office is just down the hill\n",
            "look up prince ea s youtube video you are not depressed stop it i ve never been more infuriated by a video in my life\n",
            "i didn t realize the severity of depression until it happened to me there s definite levels to it and i think you need to hit the base line of each level to fully understand the severity of it i will never ever try to help someone next time with stuff like go outside go for a walk workout or journal your thoughts that used to help me when i was upset or seasonally depressed i guess but whatever i have now just sucks the life out of you\n",
            "what makes no sense is people suffering from depression that stick to a diet of pills only they ll explain how depression keeps them from living a normal life but won t attempt any form of alternative therapy beyond the typical pill regime if you re at rock bottom it might help to try something different obviously this is a blanket statement some people have tried alternative therapies and pills are the only thing that work i respect the attempt i don t respect the stubbornness instead of grunting at the idea of someone recommending you anything other than pills um maybe look into it first i have depression and nothing seems to work for me but at least i tried the people who sit around all day going hurr durr nothing works while only shoving ssris into their mouth piss me off people who say you re not depressed so you have no valid suggestions i m paraphrasing op are just as bad\n",
            "why are you so depressed i m not depressed right now but that might make me can you just be happy for once for me i know they wanted to help but the year of pain and trauma and self hatred and violent urges won t fix themselves by pretending to be happy so you feel better no they ll get worse i know because my brain has said all this kind of crap to me before\n",
            "that is so insane and infuriating frl when i was 15 i started experiencing depression but i had no idea what it was and just proceeded to act as if everything was fine cause when i opened up to my parents about it i was told the famous it s a part of growing up teen hormones etc so i believed them i did that think positive i denied having depression lied to doctors and tried to appear as fine as i could to everyone etc because apparently it s just normal and everybody goes through it i ended up worsening my depression to a severe state and developing psychosis\n",
            "it really is ridiculous and insulting when people tell me just go outside i ve been outside and i m happy for 5 minutes until i remember why i m depressed or even better my crippling depression and anxiety have made me feel trapped in my bed and completely devoid of any desire to do anything ooh but i have so much i can do yes maybe when my brain isn t constantly telling me all the reasons i can t i am doing better and i am thankful for that but not by just loving myself or taking a walk many times while trying to do those things and forcing myself to be better i pushed myself further into depression\n",
            "ironically before i became depressed i used to think all depressed people needed to do was eat well exercise and get enough sleep i thought depressed people were just lazy mind you i was about 13 when these were my opinions when i got hit with major depressive disorder at 17 ohhh boy did my views change drastically at 21 i am only now beginning to make progress on healing my depression sending copious amounts of love to anyone out there going through this invisible battle it takes incredible strength hold on to hope\n",
            "i m not sure what s worse being told that i m weak lame pathetic etc and that i should just toughen up and get over it or being told that things will get better just by positivity\n",
            "you have so much more time yeah no big deal how i have already wasted my entire youth\n",
            "i m not going to lie i do this sometimes because i know that persone in front of me needs something to be attached to something to hang on otherwise for them their life will going downhill endlessly so at least with a few comments they stay at the state they are or maybe they get better in best case scenario\n",
            "to be fair if they never experienced it they probably have no idea how to help but they still want to because they care about you so you can be a massive prick and shit on them or you can tell them it s not helping and it s not that easy but i appreciate you tried to help me\n",
            "sometimes i wonder if these amazingly go happy people are just trying to fool themselves too by repeating what they don t believe to others i wonder if they re just going through the motions and repeatedly telling themselves they have nothing to be depressed about\n",
            "let me tell you what to do to be happy and smile and enjoy every day jk\n",
            "as much as we may be able to relate with everyone around us there s something fundamental that many people just can t get lol yeah even a friend has told me before to just be positive wish i put the effort in to tell him off it s hilarious seeing that drop in logic in all fairness i don t think there s much an average person can do to help on a deeper level anyways in regards to rearranging the complexes in our heads\n",
            "like teaching somebody to ride a horse when they don t know how to ride a horse\n",
            "i know god it makes me so mad how could they ever know what it s like\n",
            "roommate told me yesterday our generation has nothing to be said about exercise is the only cure for depression\n",
            "yes it annoys me too sometimes i just think that they don t know what it actually means to be depressed but they still wanted to help so they just say it to atleast comfort me\n",
            "its amazing how we all think our experience is unique even tho an infinite amount of people went through it before\n",
            "stop thinking so negatively i hate when they ask me to stop thinking about all the wrong things in my life or stop being miserable when i fucking try and it s fucking hard\n",
            "i do understand its horrible and annoying but things will most likely get better though i had have depression but got out of it mostly because i had to or my life would end its not easy its not done i n1 day but it is possible sadly some people do not understand how it works\n",
            "also when your depression becomes non functional for some time and you re told to just force yourself to do stuff when that s what i already try to do every single day it s not bad advice per se but it s really given like they don t get how hard it is for someone with depression i feel guilty about it already and the line just force yourself to do it makes me feel even more like crap for something i can t actually fully control because it s presented like something that should be easy\n",
            "had this argument with my father just yesterday sad was his attitude but i can t blame him he has too much on his head all the moment that these kind of things are considered a luxury to him he must think i should do something to keep my mind occupied and so i don t be depressed but i can t be productive the way i want to be on how much depressed i ve been for the past 7 years i did treatment and all for a good 4 years it s just i m fighting constantly to keep my motivation which drains me mentally and physically\n",
            "as much as i agree with you they don t say things like this to be mean it s hard to understand something that you have never gone through yourself they are often trying to be positive and help but are not sure how\n",
            "it s belittling and then you start to feel guilty like some people have it worse than you so i don t deserve to be depressed i shouldn t be depressed because my life isn t that bad but no no depression is like rain cloud over you at all times an emptiness and nothingness present that rips away your pleasure interests and motivation it s a vicious cycle of not wanting to do anything or be anything but the only way to get out of it is to do something it s emotionally and physically draining it s always there a shadow you can t explain to others\n",
            "i work with someone who says he is only happy because god only wants him to be happy he also told me god wakes me up every morning\n",
            "what you fail to consider is a lot of people saying those things may have overcome depression themselves and are giving you some insight into how they turned their life around if your depression has to do with not liking yourself the ultimate thing that will make you happy isn t being rich dating someone getting in shape etc it s liking yourself and even learning to just love yourself honestly the one lacking thing about this sub is that while it provides a great place for people to discuss their issues openly and hear from other people with similar problems it also opens it up to a bunch of people with distorted thoughts from depression reinforcing those thoughts with each other\n",
            "i m kinda late as per usual but i have to comment this time the just love yourself line makes my motivation suddenly come back from all the blood boiling i get specially because it usually comes from that 20 something guy gal who can t stop being right all the time in every life choice no ill will against anybody just stating my experience i m glad other people can enjoy life it s just i cannot and everytime i try reality just punches me back down another one of my favourites is i m sure everything will be alright this last one is specially great when they are saying it while glued to their phones texting their so edit i m sorry if that was too strong but that kind of behaviour really triggers me because of personal experience\n",
            "there s a great video somewhere on youtube that makes a compelling case that those who haven t experienced nearly as bad of luck have a hard time understanding those who have and how they often turn out to be our leaders which is maybe not the best\n",
            "i get what you re saying and their oversimplification can definitely be very frustrating and condescending but you also shouldn t assume that none of them have ever dealt with depression that seemingly cartoonish optimism might be more for them than for you\n",
            "agree completely after being depressed for more than 3 years i find out that it s really hard for me to love myself my self esteem is severely damaged and because i dont love myself at all i dont have any energy to focus on things that help me improve my life or sometimes even wake up in the morning is a burden things wont get better automatically so it s a cycle that i ve been trapped in 1\n",
            "my sil was depressed before and she just threw it away just like that i should be able to do the same if i really want to because i don t need it\n",
            "or like telling you to just go outside more and breathe some fresh air like that will cure depression brighter days with lots of sun does help me feel better but going outside makes me feel my extreme social anxiety so no ty i get that a lot anytime i try to open up a bit i get told is cuz i don t go outside much and get no fresh air here depression doesn t exist as a sickness people will just roll their eyes and tell you to just shut up with your nonsense so i never ever told anyone about it or went to doctors cuz im raised where depression isn t a big deal and isn t a sickness there is a saying in my language which means people that ate full have no sympathy for the hungry which is so true people that don t feel same have no sympathy and can t comprehend what you feel like a girl boy who is in love with you but you don t love them back you aren t wondering what they are doing right now you don t burn with passion to message them or meet them yet they are crazy about you and you just don t understand their feelings at all weird example sorry but i always think about it\n",
            "this used to really annoy me when people did this as i grew up and realised everyone struggling with their own problems and that the people that said this to me care about me it stopped annoying me they have good intentions and they want things to get better for me\n",
            "i call it toxic positivity i fucking hate it when people tell me to cheer up be happy don t be sad and your not depressed your just sad\n",
            "it s easier to make a connection with other people who ve experienced depression because they get it where as someone who has never experienced severe depression will just never get it so there potentially something major about me you that this other person will never be able to understand it s easier to not even talk about it with them and only discuss depression with other friends who have experienced it as well\n",
            "my favorite is when they say that being suicidal is selfish as if we don t already tell ourselves that\n",
            "this is the conversation i have with these people if you lied down on the floor face up and i came up on you holding a cinder block over your head would i need to drop it on your face to know it would hurt the person if taking you seriously will always answer no that s when i conclude with but maybe you would need me to drop it so you would know how it hurts\n",
            "you re generalizing people everyone never had depression lives an extremely happy and successful life how would you know this unless you had walked in their shoes experienced all the highs and lows they had some people never vocalize their internal struggles they are also giving you their opinion of how to cure depression it doesn t mean they are right or wrong it s not a fact\n",
            "we are all different people and respond differently to the world everyone gets depressed and some have found ways to get out of it\n",
            "i think people without depression see depression as like hanging out with a friend you don t like just stop hanging out with that friend and you ll be happier and they don t realize that the bad friend is actually like a 1000 year old ancient deity that decided to make you its host and possess you slowly you can exorcise it have it purified and try to trap it in a church but it s old and powerful and patient and it wants to be with you but it s mostly quiet and no matter how hard you try to ignore it it s always behind you with glowing yellow eyes just waiting for you to be weak and try to take you over maybe this is a bad analogy idk lol it seems true to me at least\n",
            "i saw a reddit post of a person saying if you keep talking about how depressed you are and how hard your life is people are going to stop speaking to you and you ll lose friends that person has clearly does not have depression understand it or has never struggled with mental illness\n",
            "fr wish they would just shut up i ve been told that depression is just all in ur head and you have to fight it like the fuck if it was that easy don t u think i would be happy\n",
            "here s what pisses me off many suicides are the result of financial problems right but suicide prevention never addresses this i mean why isn t the mental health community calling for a basic income why haven t they lobbied to undo the reagan era gutting of mental healthcare nope the just tell people not to do it but never address the underlying problem if they were serious about helping people we would have low cost walk in clinics that offered 1 counseling services 2 low cost medication similar to the planned parent model 3 financial aid and 4 help accessing community programs need funding hit up the dozens of churches in the area but i think it s really an issue of the mental health workers having a pretty good life and not really understanding that some people simply can t exercise their way out of a shitty situation\n",
            "that s true like one of my older cousins he s always in a good motivated mood and i respect his pov alot because he s lived and been in my shoes but sometimes i feel he doesn t understand me emotionally because he s never had to take medications never had to deal with therapists and psychiatrists he s always going to the gym and working out and he tries to tell me to do this and that and my life will work itself out and i can t dispute him because he ll take it the wrong way but yeah i get it\n",

            "ugh this is so annoying the narrative they always teach everyone is that depression as an illness low mood sad all the time hopeless demotivated we need to seriously change this anyone who has experienced depression as an illness and not just an emotion knows how debilitating it actually is it s not even about the above symptoms based on my experience those are just a side effect of a bigger problem depression literally made me unable to function same with anxiety if you were to ask me what specifically are you depressed about the answer is nothing specifically yes i went through a tonne of trauma throughout my childhood and teen years which probably plays a role in why i am like this but not everyone who goes through trauma becomes depressed and not everyone who is depressed has necessarily gone through any trauma to trigger it the current theory is that it is biopsychosocial predisposed due to family history and then triggered by external environment and or internal environments hormones imbalance ect when i say i can t function i literally can t i can t get up i can t focus its not that i don t want to and just need to get my shit together i assure no one would want to be like this especially for 10 years why would anyone it s stupid that people don t realize this if it is something that could be willed away nobody would have depression or any mental illness at my worst it feels like i am in a dream state my mind is foggy i m exhausted easily i can t focus on anything such that s it s easier and less painful to just do nothing i feel like i m moving in slow motion my reaction time is slowed down it s like my mind or brain takes in sensory information from the world but isn t able to process it well i wish i could give these people my depression for half a day so they know what it s like and not belittle us it s frustrating the abuse or judgement i have had to deal with from professors peers family colleagues bosses doctors therapist counsellor it adds to all the exhaustion we need to be able to get help in a safe environment we need to feel like we can get help the stigma left me to suffer for wayyy too long i thought i m a pathetic piece of shit that just needs to change i was told by everyone in my life not to take medication often with a snicker would anyone tell a cancer patient or diabetic patient not to take meds no if we talked able depressed and mental illness in a different way i would have recognized i have it and get help sooner we need to be educated on depression and other mental illnesses better why did none of my doctor s or therapists have a discussion with me about what exactly is happening why i feel the way i do what depression actually is why didn t they ask me about my thinking and ability to concentrate i was influenced by stigma and the general notion that i m just being sad and i need to be happy even though my mind wasn t processing information i never realized that that is what is happening because no one bothered to talk to me about what is actually happening or provide information as someone who comes from a family with a history of severe mental illnesses where we had to have police multiple hospital visits and children s aid society get involved why did not one single professional prepare us kids for when we might get sick or why were we not educated on these illnesses literally no information was given everyone always says get help reach out but when you do you are met by so much ignorance even from professionals i told a doctor that i just felt like i was being pathetic and needed to get it together and you know what she said i agree the doctor who is supposed to be treating me for my mental illness why did i just fill out a questionnaire and then have them examine me like a specimen only to prescribe meds without really talking to me or providing any information and send me on my way even when i told them i am scared they told me to breath better and gave me a list of workshops to attend on top of uni classes when i could barely even get out of bed like sure those can be informative but it isn t helping if i can barely get to them i m here right now why are you not giving me time and talking to me but then at workshops they don t even really tell you anything beside what you know already for the 100th time here are the numbers you can call here is a pamphlet these are breathing exercises these are how many people are effected in our country why don t they tell us more about what actually happens in a depressed person s body why don t they talk in detail about what it feels like maybe then we can feel a little less guilty and less like this is our fault advocate for yourself well i was a fucking teenager i don t have a support system so i had to deal with shit for years before i was lucky enough to come across professionals that are attentive and actually helping i struggled to find support for years until a couple years ago when mental health was beginning to be understood even though its the 21st century they had the same information before and depression is supposedly the most documented disease over all time i am angry because we still have to deal with so much ignorance and stigma from people who don t have mental illnesses and think we are just making this up why would anyone want to make this up mental illness ruined my life and took so much away from me do you seriously think i want to be like this i always wonder who i would be today if i never got sick and that upsets me also would you question the existence of someone s cancer or other physical illness injury no so why this because you can t see it well actually you can you see it in the person pay attention to them and stop judging maybe you ll notice how hard it is go read about this we have google there is so much research and information that actually shows evidence like genes and differences in brain imaging i should have gotten help years ago as a child or as a teenager when i drastically deteriorated over very short periods of time a week or less it s not that nobody paid attention they just judged and ignored i resent a lot of my school teachers peers and family members i was a child fuck you for being selfish and ignorant when that student in highschool died by suicide you provided support to students by having a social worker come in and say it s a selfish thing to do so don t do it well guess what most of the students in the classroom probably aren t suicidal but the one or two that may be do you seriously think they will now be inclined to reach out do you think with that kind of rhetoric people will be willing to help others why did it take so many deaths before the tiniest bit of change was enacted we need more mental illness costs billions of dollars to the economy yet we only invest thousands of dollars into its treatment if you are someone who doesn t have to deal with mental illness congratulations if you are also one of those people who thinks this isn t real please educated yourself stop being selfish and basing things off of your experience when you are one of nearly 8 billion people worldwide and if you still think it isn t real or could care less then please don t make a mental illness sufferers life and ability to get help worse by belittling them especially if you are an authority figure that has an influence on them and also an ability to help them this goes to teachers professors peers nearly everyone i m honestly tired i think lots of people are mental illness is debilitating and isolating already we don t need the added stigma from the world to make it worse thank you if you made it this far i just kept writing and writing\n",

            "100 in the same boat i had it before starting on citalopram but its become worse since them i feel like i m just floating through life a bit detached from everything my head feels muddled and i can t stick to one train of thought long i can t focus and worst of all there s my memory and sense of time all the days just muddle and merge into each other i m constantly forgetting what i m doing and i feel like my work colleagues just think i m really ditsy my therapist suggested mindfulness could help but haven t stuck to it enough to say if it would\n",
            "i have part of these symptoms that seem to get worse on medication the loss of focus and memory due to my ssri i have theorized that since we remember the most emotional things from out past really well that the lessening of strong emotions has affected my memory possibly more that the average person us depressives may be so used to feeling strong emotions that our brains wired pathways to function on those emotions as the medication takes the edge off my brain doesnt seem to know what is important anymore which is my theory on the add side affect my solution has been to try to practice and wire new pathways hey this is my brain chemistry now i need to find a way to function with it so i m trying to put in to place systems and tiny habits meditation seems to help breaking a cycle of wandering thoughts cbt of course helps too\n",
            "i have the same feelings but i also have cml so i don t know if it s because of my illness or depressing\n",
            "i know how horrible it is to have permanent brain fog i ve had brain fog for roughly 4 years now from which a year almost permanent like i was constantly half asleep for me it was an accident and the depression that followed from going through heavy injuries so guess the cause is a bit mixed veeery slowely it started to get away with lots and lots of physiotherapy time perseverance sometimes medication it took me 4 years to have the fog thing only a few moments a day sometimes its worse when im upset or sleep bad but on good days i barely notice it and its nowhere near the point where it s interfering with my daily life im not saying there is a miracle cure but it can get better even after years\n",
            "same symptoms what helped me was forcing this inner monolgue and a decrease in my music consumption\n",
            "this is chemical depression or at least it was for me it s when you have nothing to be depressed about but your brain is not producing the right chemicals so you get tired and stupid\n",
            "which antidepressant s are you on i was on just an ssri for a long time citalopram and it helped immensely for my anxiety but did not touch my depression at all i was reluctant to try any add on medications because i was worried about the potential for more weight gain but i went back to my doctor talked over more options with him and eventually settled on bupropion the generic for wellbutrin as an add on to my ssri since wellbutrin doesn t cause weight gain i ve struggled with some of the brain fog symptoms you described and after almost 2 weeks of taking wellbutrin on top of my ssri i can feel the fog starting to lift i m going back to my doctor to discuss my progress and see if the dose is right but i m optimistic based on what i ve seen so far i don t know what your specific situation is but it may be worth talking to your doctor psychiatrist about add on meds or if you ve already done that you can disregard my reply entirely lol depression is a real bitch and i sincerely hope you can find some relief\n",
            "my brain fog is a result of performance anxiety it used to only occur at school where i would just zone out and have a blank mind now it s almost all the time but it s off and on\n",
            "absolutely even when looking at the small number of accomplishments i have i can t understand how i actually achieved them if i feel like this all the time\n",
            "this is me i just couldn t put it into words it s unfortunate that you re going through it as well but even though we don t know each other like everyone here we can offer words of encouragement to hopefully brighten your day so try to keep your head up and i ll do the same knowing were both battling similar things we can battle them together all the best my friend\n",
            "we are all a shell of our former selves there once was a time where we dream of becoming a person that we so desired but reality hits ud and we are nowhere near to the person that we have dreamt to be\n",
            "experienced that after a minor stroke i couldn t tell what was missing after i woke up on the floor again but i felt there was something missing and indeed decreased potential by 25 to keep things in mind and sometimes i feel like i forget things right after done i feel very fucked after 8hours or more of sleep and hand foot eye coordination is always some kind of disturbed if you have the possibility try to get into a ct or mrt to make sure\n",
            "i 22f struggle with this too and it literally fucking plagues me so i feel you a large part of my depressive spirals is that my brain feels utterly paralyzed i just have constant brain fog i fumble words mix things up i can t seem to remember anything new and my critical thinking feels impaired it feels like i m always half asleep no matter how much i sleep i m just always confused it s so frustrating especially when i talk to other people our age people who seem to have this amazing ever growing creativity thirst to experience things desire to learn and my head feels like it s full of cotton i honest to god wonder if this is how most people feel but no one talks about it because it s embarrassing\n",
            "omfg thats what that is and i thought that was normal or something for me its like i have wet cotton or a wet sponge in my head and i have like a realy bad memory and zone out realy often and can t concentrate\n",
            "physical exercise is great for this clears the fog especially if you do it when it s early morning or when you don t want to little by little just keep getting better stay disciplined try one small new thing ecru day even if it s a different route home buying a new food learning something new reading a new book etc\n",
            "me severe adhd and chaotic childhood 10 15 years of healing and i can confirm that everything is like a wound or a seed takes a while to heal takes a while to grow but it definitely happens i d say i m 80 90 better and overall 55 different since those years ago and i don t have a whole lot going on for me right now except stability which i appreciate it s impossible not to heal grow over time you don t even have a choice but to get better unless something horrible happens to hinder your progress and that shouldn t happen unless you get really unlucky or self destructive happens sometimes and you recover from that too\n",
            "can someone maybe help idk if it s the same thing but i m 12 and this happens a lot i guess i just lose the thought of reality it s like watching a long ass movie smh idk if this happens with anyone else but i also get horrible mood swings and get super paranoid and then become super sad i think i might be bipolar or something been happening for years but don t want to self diagnose and it s kinda hard talking about feelings as i m a guy who s always joking and just doesn t seem like i ve ever been in a dark place but it s either constant sadness or panic or happiness or like i stated before lost of consciousness i just jump from one to another and light with anger by the smallest things anyone know what this is\n",
            "hey thought this was wild when i saw this post and i wanted to ask are you really tired a lot of the time too no matter how much sleep you get it s cause i ve got narcolepsy with cataplexy and one of the key parts of it is the brain fog it used to be i couldn t focus on anything but tryna keep my eyes open but nowadays i m not even aware of going into it i just can t concentrate on anything for a while then much later i m like shit i can t remember what happened for the last 20 minutes i got on the luckier side with narcolepsy because mine presents with cataplexy which is real obvious physical sign something aint right lol but narcolepsy on its own can be really hard to diagnose and people can go decades without realising they have it i m sick of brain fog too it s bullshit when there s so much you have to get done in a day you re not alone\n",
            "i get this alot i know you would have been told before but brutal exercise helps this i take a 45 min spin class which gets me out of the fog i think it might be the adrenaline or endorphins released or maybe just because you did something positive hard to start hard to even get up in the morning but it does make a difference also i would 100 recommend meditation or yoga to calm those nasty voices\n",
            "i ve been experiencing this hardcore i think for me it happened when i convinced myself i needed to constantly be on my game or constantly prepared for whatever obstacle was going to come next it took away the spontaneity i used to revel in i ve been ready to re embrace that spontaneity for months now if only this pandemic would let us all live\n",
            "i can relate i find it important to remember that memories naturally change over time the good parts tend to stay and the bad parts tend to get forgotten the comparison is unfair to your current self and doesn t represent reality\n",
            "i think it may be because ive started drinking constantly but ive experienced this a lot\n",
            "as someone with mental health background both professionally and personally and as hard as it may be don t give up hope by that i mean i understand how draining it can be to talk to multiple doctors or constantly switching medications especially when you don t have energy in the first place but everyone responds very differently to medications because our brain chemistry and compositions are different i think what helped me get through the rut or climb out of the hole was constantly focusing on the way i felt and things i could do when my mental health was under control that drove me to get better remember the things you use to love let that drive you also not for everyone but i started listening to the mindset mentor on podcast podcasts changed my life i had something to focus on and it was all positive information that really helped me change my mindset i think i could go on forever but hopefully some stuff i shared helped you are loved\n",
            "i don t have any answers but know you aren t alone i can t concentrate on anything anymore either\n",
            "i m so happy you posted this i ve been saying this for the past month and just thought i was losing my mental state slowly thank you i had no idea this was even a thing as well as something because of depression if anyone has a way to help pls let me know\n",
            "i never had a good brain to begin with with age my memory has gotten worse and worse and if something isn t important to me will just completely forget it\n",
            "yes exactly this dementia also runs in my family so i ve been worrying that it s down to that\n",
            "i literally started to think i have demencia because i keep forgetting more and more even basic words\n",
            "i think this is really common though and you can retrain your brain to get better at it again but depression does get in the way of that motivation to do so\n",
            "this used to happen to me all the time for so many years i have bpd and i m working effectively on eradicating and and have been working on myself so hard that i have noticed the difference i can actually concentrate on hearing an audiobook i can talk and keep the conversation etc there is hope but you just have to work on yourself\n",
            "can t focus for shit at times i feel like a passenger and i barely form memories since maybe 10 years back literally i went backpacking for a year and i remember maybe a week total if i add up the days i remember it s actually fucking concerning but i ve just lived with it so i know nothing else\n",
            "i was just explaining this to my dr and we concluded that it s just part of the depression the hard part is getting through the fog into that clarity which will just take time self care and medication it s shitty i know just don t give up you can get through this\n",
            "some days are worse than others i have brain damage from getting knocked out twice and then many concussions after that\n",

            "im a 37 year old male and i can definitely relate to this ive thought about this alot do you think it has to do with all the negative stuff that occupys our mind all of the time its like we are not focused on the present but the negative from the past or is it just me\n",
            "fasting can really clear your mind up a lot do some research on how to prepare for a 3 day water fast and experiment it it s quite amazing actually the first one might be hard depending on how much toxicity you have inside headaches lack of strength but after a few like once a month you ll definitely feel so much cleaner clear in your thoughts after a couple of times the fasts become much easier and you ll feel all your senses like smell taste touch etc become a lot sharper\n",
            "i feel you 100 i ve been going through the exact same shit it s like i m looking at someone else s life as a mere passenger my thoughts start off just fine but then they trail off half way through leaving me dumb founded i constantly forget what i was just about to do or think most of the time i have no idea how i m feeling i can only describe it as generally bad i feel empty and numb and foggy i fucking hate it and it s so tiring i imagine this is what an alzheimers disease must feel like even though i m only 21 i wish you all the best friend i know this hole we all find ourselves in seems impossible to get out of but maybe there is a way if we keep searching 3 take care all of you\n",
            "this is literally my life i have some days where i m clear and then the next day i ll feel foggy again i purposely avoid interacting with others because i feel like i m not there and i m in a fog and i can t concentrate it s very frustrating and it s so hard to constantly explain it to others\n",

            "i absolutely agree i m a 21 year old female and i ve never done drugs or anything of the sort i ve had depression for about 5 years now and it s exactly as you say i ve never had a clear moment even once in the last five years\n",
            "not to discourage you to get off antidepressants but i got brain fog whenever i was on them i finally decided that i d try to treat depression more naturally it sucked for a long time but eventually i started getting better sleep after getting nasal surgery exercising more eating healthier etc my theory is that depression is usually a symptom of something else going on in the body or mind i m not saying i m cured but i feel a lot better physically and mentally than i used to\n",
            "i understand and i know exactly what you re talking about when i was a teenager felt like i could remember everything pay attention to so many things at the same time didn t have to study much for tests because i remembered everything already now it feels like my brain is shrinking more each day and i can t focus on anything besides the numerous thoughts in my head all the time feels like my days are so long and exhausting\n",
            "yez this was absolutely the worst part i was in university but couldn t study because my brain simply wasn t there and i felt useless and stupid my depression is environmental and a therapist change started to make effects i have my brain again just as sharp witty and reasoning oriented as it used to be please op hold on because i promise you the feeling of when you suddenly realize your mind is slowly becoming your own again is the best thing that can happen\n",
            "i m 21 and have been feeling this way for the past 4 years i always chalked it up to me starting to get extremely depressed switching meds etc i stopped going to college because of it and now i feel like a complete idiot like i know i m smarter than this but there s this wall of fog in my brain and it annoys the shit out of me because it prevents me from thinking clearly ever\n",
            "i suffered that brain fog last year and this january i couldn t focus even my sight is hazy my memory was failing my intellect going down i thought i lacked water or maybe ate too much sugar so made sure to be hydrated and cut on sweets but my brain fog persisted and it s already affecting my job i couldn t think properly so my psychiatrist prescribed fluoxetine and 20 days rest for depression and i dont know which one did it the rest or meds but my mind is clearer now i figured it could be the stress that caused my brain to get hazy that s why the meds worked\n",
            "the same thing happened to me and my psychiatrist prescribed me piracetam and it has helped me tremendously\n",
            "i tried weed when i was 13 and i ever since everything goes in one ear and out the other\n",

            "exercise go for walks lift weights and get adaquete sleep making these changes helped me more than antidepressants have ever done for me\n",
            "honestly what i can say with consistent sleep and physical activity it helps antidepressants are really just a bandaid approach imo and don t treat the issue rooted deep inside saying that coming out of quarantine you re gunna have to make some changes to your lifestyle no more phone before bed limiting your alcohol intake no drugs emotional stability takes time focus on becoming a better you physics activity though is honestly for general life satisfaction and happiness you have to work on yourself internally to see the benefits externally it ll change you life man believe me if you make a plan and stick to your routine diligently you ll feel so much better in no time believe in yourself give yourself some grace give yourself some love man love yourself to love life we re on in the same\n",

            "when i had severe depression in 2013 i developed this brain fog its never fully left\n",
            "completely understand this while i m definitely not as healthy as you are i literally can t remember simple things anymore when i was a kid i was in gifted programs i know typical burnt out gifted kid thing and could remember things so easily as i got older though it s like my brain fizzled out i guess it makes me feel horrible when i can t remember things my friends and family told me not even a day ago i guess it s just a part of dealing with this but it s one of the things i hate the most about this\n",
            "has anyone found out why this happens i find myself similar to what s described but never have known why i don t take medication nor diagnosed with depression\n",
            "wonderful another reason my memory maybe bad thought it was just the epilepsy but nah this prob does it too that foggy memory is super common in epileptics called brain fog is it really a thing i needa worry about with my depression who knows\n",
            "i kind of solved that taking some piracetam every morning is a pill that you take if you are dyslexic the maximum dose per day is 24 grams but i don t think you should take more than 15 grams per day hope that this helps some of you\n",
            "op did you notice that the brain fog started after taking the antidepressants brain fog can be caused by depression itself but it can in some cases also be caused by anti depressants medications tranquilizers antidepressants some blood pressure drugs and other medications can affect memory usually by causing sedation or confusion that can make it difficult to pay close attention to new things if you noticed the brain fog starting soon after taking the antidepressants it could be related to the medication and not the depression it might be worth talking to a doctor about\n",
            "so i m not necessarily saying this is the case but this was how i felt and then i found out i have adhd it could be worth looking into even my depression was tied to it\n",

            "all the time i took l theanine as a supplement briefly and it helped with my mood and mental sharpness i just hate taking pills after having so many medicines fail me\n",
            "i forget what i m doing in the middle of doing a task all the time or i ll start doing something completely different because i forgot what i was doing it s driving me crazy\n",
            "i have the same issue and i think it s the biggest thing that prevents me from getting better i mess up at work in a relationship due to my forgetful slowness and the self hating cycle continues i m trying meditation bc i read that older folks who practiced meditation long term had a brain of 20 30yrs old i m also planning on taking bupropion again so hopefully that will help\n",
            "yeah me too i hate it when i m in the middle of something and i just zone out it s relaxing yes but i d rather not zone out when i m just cutting food or do other things that could be dangerous\n",
            "i totally relate to how you describe autopilot i almost do tasks without even thinking about them but my memory lasts less than a minute unless i force myself to think about it\n",
            "same and ssri s made it worse even though i ve been off them for a year i still think my brain fog is worse then it used to be\n",
            "i understand you it is so frustrating because is making uni really difficult for me the thing is i haven t taking meds in years\n",
            "idk prolly just being older and unhealthy but you could go to the doctor to get tested for some form of dementia\n",
            "info have you been taking the medication for a long time i was just curious because when i was on anti depressants one of the ones my doctor had me try gave me really bad fog brain like you described\n",
            "i had this super badly severe depression and adhd lol but it got so much better after finding the right meds for me bipolar meds actually improved my brain functioning along with my mood one of the first signs of improvement for me was actually my inner monologue coming back\n",
            "i feel this way all the time every now and then i would also have the same thoughts like how the hell i was so focused as kid and now i can barely ready 3 pages in a book you could have add maybe see a doctor or a psychiatrist about it\n",
            "this is actually a common symptom of depression have you taken any kind of medication or seen anyone for this i hope things turn out better for you\n",
            "yeah deffinately i mostly struggle with this when it comes to school and getting stuff done because my whole thought progress seems foggy i tend to forget things or mention them weeks later when its already too late im deffi not gonna nail school this year i do wanna mention that im 16 years of age and puberty obviously plays a big role also last year i have done various drugs not frequently thou it started of as just expirimenting and stuff but i continued to do it with some friends in times of sadness etcetera wich can be really addicting i should be happy that i dont have the money to do it that much lol bc then it would be way way more and i know drugs have influence on concentration and depression etcetera and its hard to tell for me if drugs have increased my depression since its such a small amount idk dunno exactly what im posting this for i dont know if i really want help or maybe just wanna see if anyone is in a similar situation as me btw stay strong out there these are rough times\n",
            "yep same here it s unbelievable how many people go through this and no one knows about i struggle with it everyday i keep forgetting things i walk like on clouds it s a horrible feeling i hope one day a miracle will happen and i feel better best wishes to you\n",

            "hey pleb don t worry about it too much it ll get better i ve been on a bunch of different anti depressants and the ones that work for me have been sertraline among other meds i take it have taken each of our symptoms and circumstances are different so we re obviously going to receive meds differently i ve also been on drugs and partied way too much in my twenties i m 32 for reference but i ve had a long history of depression and mental downward spirals i ve been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for over a decade now almost 2 really long time my meds change every now and then not the sertraline but some other things i m taking what i m trying to get to is be as up front and open to your doctor s about your feelings and mood and try to do things that would theoretically make you happy i like reading for example so i ve been reading books if i don t have the money to buy new ones i re read or listen to audio books online for free on youtube i m also on youtube a lot watching content depending on where you are in the world you could also do stuff outside with family or friends if that s something you d like to do don t get me wrong i love being a lone a lot of the time too i can sometimes be a hermit and spend a few days to a week without talking to anyone really and that s ok too you don t have to perform for anyone i ve found that after you become an adult you don t have to do anything anyone else tells you especially if it males your uncomfortable the only people that control you are the people that are paying your salary if you re working and customers lol but other than that don t bother making yourself depressed or stressed for no reason it s not worth your time it sounds so easy and cliche but do what you love and love what you do i get the for sometimes too i play it off and tell myself that ignorance is bliss and ignorance can be bliss you know like not knowing about the ugliness of stuff happening around the world about war and starvation and animals dying sorry to bring it up please don t look further into any of those just need to have a good example anyways another a tip just start hyping yourself up mentally tell yourself that you re the shit i know this sounds funny but look in the mirror and say it out loud even i saw this on a vid and it s supposed to work with raising self esteem and confidence tell yourself you re strong smart and beautiful and you re going to have a good day and good time it s your time and your life you re living not for anyone else don t feel bad feel like a movie star and people will see it too trust me it s taking me a while to reach this mental state and i feel better than i did years ago even though i ve been thru some hard trauma it s getting better and things are only getting started hope this helps sorry it s soo long i d recommend reading don t sweat the small stuff and it s all small stuff by richard carlson this book changed my life for the better and i think it could help you out too maybe no promises hope you re happy and healthy during covid\n",
            "i always felt like this brain fog i was experiencing was just temporary but sadly as time has gone on its clear what impact stress and depression has on the human mind i question if i even have 1 brain cell at times it is so frustrating but i just try remind myself that i m still here through all that b s surviving with my slow mind we alqays have something to bring to the table even when we have slowed down like yourself i feel i have tried everything to no avail being 22 in the 21st century is not so great\n",
            "wow that actually makes me relate so much i am fully capable now as i had to be hospitalised back in a day but even if i do all functions and it feels i m on the right track i feel dead most of the days and this brain fog thing is really taking away all enjoyment from life it s like i run on outpilot i can rationally assess things and make decisions and i genuinely react if something or someone makes me laugh but if feels fake and forced i don t remember when the last time i actually genuinely laughed\n",

            "i understand how you feel some days its hard to find motivation to live life especially when you feel behind everyone in life or if you ve had a lot of trauma in life we can make our own purpose you mentioned that you really love your parents maybe you could spend some more time with them and let that be your purpose for now while you figure everything out\n",

            "i can relate so much to this i posted something very similar to this a few days ago and right after i posted it i didn t feel like myself i didn t like that i as a human was asking questions about how to die when instead i should be asking how to live but how do you do that how the fuck do u do that when the ground beneath your feet shakes every time you stand up even though every scathing moment begs for relief from this awful exisistence there is a sliver of curiosity that tells me to live another day sorry survive another day i don t know how much of it is left in the bank but until then r depression will keep me company\n",
            "i used to be at the same place until i realized that my home wasn t really nurturing what i thought was normal wasn t it was leaving me stunted and unsure of myself and made me shrink as a person maybe if it is possible for you to do such a deep dive then you should attempt it today i actually have an image in my head of what a good life might look like to me and that s a lot more than i had just a few months ago on a side note that life isn t of the white picket fence variety i want to get a doctorate in clinical psychology and work with narcissistic abuse survivors i would like to maybe have a baby through ivf and not wait indefinitely for an ideal partner and lastly i would really like to retire and move to the countryside with a pet cat and dog and have a little vegetable garden i honestly couldn t think to even a few days into the future and lived entirely in the past until a few months ago also i don t think most people truly know what they want with their lives they make it up and make it work as they go so maybe just try to get something going i can t help you very much here because i m kind of figuring things out too\n",

            "i wish i could tell you that there s hope and a chance to be better and that i believe it that feeling living without goals or motivation flying through life on autopilot living for the convenience of your family it s debilitating no matter how many pills i take or therapy sessions i attend it has not gotten any better at all i welcome death though i fear it you re not alone in this hell but i know you feel lonely and that might be worse\n",
            "my therapist has said of course you want to opt out this is a fantasy of being able to escape without consequence and fantasies are powerful so even though we don t give into it acknowledging this sucks i don t want to do it can be a healthy response and be very useful in shouldering the weight of depression sometimes\n",
            "i know what you mean but think about this since nothing matters then you get to do whatever the hell it is you want this world now becomes your playground because you re right it really doesn t matter at the end of day in any case that s why i started smoking weed got a piercing dyed my hair and trying to travel the world and experience many experiences if there is another world out there after life then i want a great story to tell hope this helps also i was high typing this\n",

            "i can completely relate to this sentiment sucks because you don t want to burden those you love with these thoughts and it s tricky to talk about in therapy in my experience i ll never forget about 2 decades ago the esc button fell off my keyboard and i kept it just wishing i could press escape on my own worldly experience wish i could i guess for now i m choosing to keep on swimming\n",

            "what do you do for your life if i may ask to make your life better i think theres clinical depression and something called congruent depression if you have no motivation wanna lay in bed all day lack of motivation i would call that congruent depression and i think many people have that its not an illness its a depression that can go on for years or even a life time if your life is sedatary full of no motivation and you feel stuck perhaps you feel like you should have achieved more at your age because of people around you but its not an illness it doesn t need meds your body and mind should be feeling that way seeing as how you have been the passed few years dont look for meds to solve your problems they make it worse for most people with congruent depression which is why you see everyone posting about how no meds help them and nothing ever will clinical depression is like your doing everything right in life you have a good job you have a beautiful spouse w e right you should be feeling that way its not a neurochemical imbalance most the time its the fact you haven t done anything ive been the same way for multiple years im just now learning its my fault you can t blame a neuropathy problem for your anhedonia when you aren t even doing anything to treat it besides the ssris or anti depression meds people take for it which makes your mind heal even worse because ur used to thus unnatural way of putting it into your body instead find the reason why your depressed work on it apologize to all of those you have wronged\n",

            "yea i ve been so sad lately and it would mean so much if anyone would tell me that i d be alright but no one knows that i m sad mostly because i try to seem optimistic i feel like my efforts in making friends only backfired and made me seem like a player even though all i wanted was a friend and literally nothing more it hurts me that no one wants to talk to me for that reason and i know that no one will care to check up\n",

            "i once not committed suicide just because someone came and told me merry christmas it was 3 years ago some days before christmas and i was really depressed\n",
            "definitely in fact i m that way now the thing is i don t talk to any of my friends from high school much anymore not that i had many anyway i d love to hear a genuine are you okay not someone asking who doesn t really care even if i got that though i d still end up lying and pretending everything is alright a hug with someone i really care about might cause me to break down\n",
            "yeah i had this crushing feeling last night when i was alone at home watching tv it just washed over me a wave of dread and longing i just crossed my arms over my chest and rubbed my hands up and down my arms sometimes i wake up in the morning and crave the feeling of my hands on a female ass so i give mine a little feel and a slap lol sounds ridiculous but it helps me i had this lovely dream the other night i was at a party and a beautiful blonde girl sat next to me smiled and asked me to kiss her gently as i moved in to kiss her i could smell her perfume and her hair and i woke up feeling refreshed and contented for a while\n",
            "thank you for posting this i m so sorry you feel the same way but i am also glad i m not the only one who feels this way sending you virtual hugs\n",
            "i don t want people around because i know they will disappoint me believe more in yourself you are the only one who can understand you\n",
            "i got to the point where my partner would just be holding my hand when we were both watching videos on our phones or something and i would let out the biggest cry i would avoid hugs because i would get so emotional i were held for too long even a stranger that doesn t know what i m going through asking if i m ok i would tear up and say yeah i m alright\n",
            "that s basically my whole life it would be nice if somebody took me by the hand for a walk but it simply doesn t happen\n",
            "yes i don t speak to anyone or have friends but i do hookup with guys i use this to get out any intatmite feelings id wanna express like kissing and hugging it s stupid i know but sometimes i look forward to my hookups because for a brief moment i have someone to talk to someone who wants to hug me but it s only temporary\n",
            "the fact that when you need a hug the most there is no one simply terrifies me\n",
            "oh yes plenty of times sometimes i get to that point in which i just want to give up on everything and shut down for awhile but i can t i want to but i just can t bring myself to do it\n",
            "why the hell am i crying oh shit someone left a bowl of onion sorry y all\n",
            "i always wanted that but i always get explosive responses of why i m emotional friends say i m too emotional that no one can talk to me now being emotional is a taboo to me all they can do is give advises and remind me that my emotions hurt them too what about me i always get left out where i care for another person and mine gets understated i didn t do anything wrong you need to control your emotions you have not grown then they would say i m too stuck with those thoughts and get offended because they feel like a bad person or i m making them a bad person it s like they re victimizing themselves so my emotions don t come across why you keep holding onto them you have to let them go why you keep digging up the past when i feel hurt by someone s actions or statement i don t deserve to get emotionally acknowledge but i have to acknowledge others why is it always my fault don t you try guilt tripping me why can t anyone feel my pain i feel alone and no one knows that at a same time i don t want them to know because it s a cycle again\n",
            "all the time when i ve actually had a relationship all i wanted when i first saw them was just a long hug\n",
            "yup but sadly there isn t anyone to give it to me so i end up staying in the shower for 40 minutes\n",
            "i do these days but it reminds me that i ve been left alone in a web of lies because my culture was one of people pleaser denial and fakeness and now it s kinda too late i just wasn t capable of responding on others lack of trust and overwhelmed by issues and now there s really nothing one can say that can fix my problems it s 99 999 loss i have to swallow\n",
            "i have a decent sized family and i ve never heard this it makes the pain so much worse\n",
            "definitely i remember sobbing like hell one day because a worker in a comic shop said she really liked my tshirt and hoped i had a nice day and smiled at me it was the first genuinely good feeling thing someone had said to me that week\n",
            "i remember over a year ago i was extremely lonely had a bad day got home and my dad texted me did you get home safely and when i saw that i honestly just started to cry\n",
            "honestly i ve gotten so lonely that i want to be lonely i ve pushed so many people away just to make sure people think i m ok instead of people worrying about me\n",
            "my friend did this to me once i was going to commit suicide i had everything planned out he saw how tired and drained i was and asked me whats wrong when i said nothing he asked again i said a lot he hugged me and i never felt so happy but so sad at the same time\n",
            "a hug is all i want because i know nothing can make me better permanently unfortunately i m living alone overseas for studies my dog is back at home and my so and i are ldr my dog and him are the only ones i d willingly hug at times like this tbh\n",
            "one hundred percent but knowing how i act normal and hide everything with a smile people probably won t suspect anything is going wrong with my life this might sound sad or stupid but i actually pretend someone or my alternate self is actually patting my back and asking if everything is alright lol it makes me feel a little better\n",
            "yes but my friends are more visibly unstable than me so i pretty much have n chance of that\n",
            "in my experience when i get really very severely depressed i become numb so if anyone tries to make sure i m okay i ll most likely say i am and hear the screams echo inside if you still feel something you re okay 3\n",
            "although i want those i don t have it in me to let people in most of it is my mentality but part of it is that i m not able to fulfill what they want me to do for them in my state maybe that s my mindset again though\n",
            "yes unfortunately the person felt scare about my need and ay some other moments no one was around\n",
            "i have a friend who i asked to be there in the moments when i m desperate to not be alone but can t tell it like being locked inside a bubble and desperatley trying to reache out to someone but all i can do is press my hands against the transparent wall and scream inside he s living 500km away but when i feel like thid i can text a hand emoji to him and he will take a selfie with his hand hold up like he is holding it on the other side of the wall so i know even if i feel alone and can t talk someone is trying to reach me in my bubble helped me a lot maybe you can ask someone for something like that too i d hug you and hold you scrubb your back and get clean sheets on your bed always makes me feel better if i could but the advice is the best i can give via reddit please stay strong better times will come\n",
            "i always ask me friends how they are but almost never get the same question back feel desperate for it at this point\n",
            "yep i ve felt the same for a very long time it s definitely been a good few years since my last hug and probably even more for an actual genuine one i guess i m just used to it now\n",
            "this will never happen if you are a man this will happen all the time if you are an attractive woman obviously you are a man because you think this will help but women get depression too they just get relationships too if you think this sounds good you have not spent much time around women they are more often depressed and take way more psych meds\n",
            "at some point you accept theres no such thing as caring about someone else cause whats in it for them everything is about someone s own benefit even love thats just 2 ppl lying to themselves and each other when ur so depressed u realize that no amount of happiness and meaning is big enough to make fighting your depression worth it\n",
            "yeah all i want is a hug from someone a nice long hug where i can just cry into their shoulder and them not care\n",
            "oh my gosh yes and especially during times like these hugs can do a lot and mean even more\n",
            "yeah in that situation i tend to post suicidal stories on my ig as to get attention it did work at first but now nobody cares about me and sometimes i want to do it\n",
            "i crave a hug almost everyday these days but an are you ok messes me up\n",
            "literally yesterday i was really depressed and all i wanted was a hug but the only thing i could hug was my stuffed animals\n",
            "yeah people under estimate how much a simple hand on your shoulder or arm or a hug can mean\n",
            "absolutely my kids will do it as a matter of courtesy only want a real one from the heart so bad demise near and coming soon want it over\n",
            "a very nice genuinely invested nurse once offered me a hug when she saw i was distraught and i just wanted to run away i don t think a hug has ever done anything for me\n",
            "if someone asks me how are you i will just say i don t know i just don t know how i feel anymore it is always the same as yesterday before than yesterday last month\n",
            "i literally just want a hug that will allow me to burst into tears and i just want the person to console me and be there at the moment been wanting that from the last year and a half\n",
            "i had a dream of someone walking with me on a field and holding me by my waist and now i can t stop thinking about it i m not a sexual person or whatever but i miss touch right now\n",
            "i m at the point where i m shutting even those out it s like painful to hear people talking to me\n",
            "feel like this all the time actually haven t gotten a hug from anyone in a while\n",
            "all the time thats why i ended up starting to smoke weed it was that or kolonpin\n",
            "oddly no i don t know why this is but other people are of no comfort to me when i m depressed and a precious little comfort when i m not in some ways i think it s that i don t particularly want witnesses to my misery\n",
            "i sat in the pool with my friends the other day i wanted to see if they noticed if something was wrong with me i stared at the same pole for 15 minutes not one what s wrong or even a person trying casually talk towards me it s like i was invisible and i was looking in on their convo i just want to be noticed\n",
            "i ve wanted people to ask what s the matter every minute of every day since i was about 10 trouble is i don t like people and resent their opinions their tastes and their overall world views you might say i m a difficult person\n",
            "i literally just want to bump into someone at the grocery store and say excuse me\n",
            "i wish i got an are you okay from my support system and maybe a hug but covid is such a bitch also i want cuddles but idk i m a pisces and a baby for any type of affection\n",
            "every single day yes as someone else already said i m at the point where receiving either will make me break down\n",
            "this was basically my teens too bad i felt i was too disgusting unlovable to dare ask for one\n",
            "at my lowest point i imagined getting a hug from a neighbour i barely speak to\n",
            "for me a hug would be great easy an are you okay would probably send me on a downward spiral trying to figure out the right way to answer the question\n",
            "yes happens often actually that s my default mindset the only way i try avoid delay feeling depression is my being busy but a hug are you okay would def help alot sometimes that s all you need really just someone to check up on you\n",
            "the other day i was scrolling through facebook and saw a kit kat ad for r u ok day a suicide prevention campaign in australia and i just completely broke down edit clarity\n",
            "yes i just want to meet a fcking human someone that truly cares but i don t know if i deserve it am i a human myself i don t know since my depression started everything started getting more and more confusing and i couldn t think straight and or for long periods of time\n",
            "i booked a therapist appointment today and the sympathy in the voice in the receptionist when i said i was suicidal almost made me cry bc it s the first time someone has shown me kindness in a long time\n",
            "yeah my friend said hope you are well after i told him i was taking a little break from life and shit and i literally look at that message everyday\n",
            "i ve lost about every friend or family member like this i stopped texting them stopped asking if they want to hang out haven t heard anything from any of them yet unless they need something from me even a new acquaintance at work i can t tell if he wants to be my friend or if he just wants to use the internet at my house because he lives out in the county\n",
            "i know how you feel but reciprocation can come in many many forms usually not the form you wanted expected they might not be chatting a lot with you but maybe they sent you a song and said hey i think you ll like this band my sister rarely calls me or initiate a conversation but i know she loves me bc she always includes me in her life plans makes me little presents or drawings and asks for advice same goes for my bff he rarely says something but whenever i need help or support he s there for me if the people u are concerned about demonstrate that they care about you in others ways i don t think the fact that they don t check on you means they don t care but if you re the only one checking and trying to chat and being there for them and they don t do none of this for u they re not worth your time there are people out there who would truly treasure your company\n",
            "why were cell phones created to be able to check up on others and for them to do the same no one ever calls or text me i am the one who always does and yet people get mad at me for not joining their chat groups i hate all these chat apps and group bullshit if you have my number fucking call me or text me if you want group chatting then lets get together physically not digitally\n",
            "all the time i m mostly over this stage already and straight into apathy i ll still message people i consider important enough to me as a friend or more to check up on them but i m totally not surprised nor do i give a shit anymore that nobody on my contacts list will do the same for me anyway in fact i m 99 certain that if i died tomorrow only my parents would send me off at my funeral and nobody else would even know i m gone if i suddenly stopped replying messages or disappeared from my usual social spots after the pandemic is over i guess most of me is dead inside already even if on the outside i try to put on a hard facade and act like i don t give a shit or i m fine\n",
            "i think the other way around i feel bad people aren t talking to me and then realize i could initiate contact if i wanted to but i m too tired or lazy or whatever to care and then i think maybe they feel the same way as me\n",
            "depression can rot the bonds between people in addition to causing the horrible thoughts cutting lines of emotion if someone you re helping isn t reaching back i at the outset hope you realize how awesome you are to be there for them in the first place as for reciprocation it might help to call them up and ask them out to lunch or something some people are just not callers at all and prefer the receiving treatment in communication you know\n",
            "yup i deactivated fb and mesenger recently because of this my therapist told me before i check up on someone i should ask myself why i am texting them turns out i was bored and needed validation i m now focusing on doing something to combat the boredom and trying to affirm myself instead of seeking attention elsewhere it s a battle but we ll with fighting\n",
            "and the fucked up thing when you point this out to someone that tries to call you out for never talking to them your all of a sudden the asshole\n",
            "i still check on most people even though the reciprocation isn t promt i can however not stop myself only because they re not caring the same way it makes me feel selfish idk why i m more of an empath who d put themselves in other s shoes so i end up finding excuses for them about not checking up on me i realize it s toxic somewhat for me and there would be days when i m pretty low on mental health and could use a friend to vent on but won t have any but i do i i love when people use me to vent on and i sense their relief so right now i m in between striking a balance between my needs and others\n",
            "i have been struggling with this so badly lately i ve been checking up on so many people whom i normally wouldn t check up on then i get a bit salty and feel annoyed that nobody really reaches out to me when i m struggling\n",
            "have checked up on some of my friends but you know none of them do back only one has and im glad he has fr tho hate when people start saying oh ill always be here for you man ill check up on you once in a while funny that they never do edit spelling\n",
            "once you realise this the facade falls and you see they never really cared or liked you they just couldn t say it to your face\n",
            "i feel that it s really hard especially during this time i have reached out to people before and they did reply back but i hate how hardly any of them ever reach out to me in return it makes me feel like i m nothing to them it hurts a lot i know people are busy with things like work their online classes family etc it just would be nice for any of my friends to reach out to me\n",
            "exactly if someone cared about me they would make a tiny effort to stay in touch they don t so that s the end of the story\n",
            "sometimes i ask someone how their day was just so they ll ask me about mine to me it doesn t rly make a difference but i feel your pain bro\n",
            "yes and because i m lonely i don t always want to be the one reaching out out of desperation it isn t healthy\n",
            "friendship is a two way street and if your friend is treating you like a drive through therapy it s time to block off the drive through that shit is just toxic i ve had many friends come to me and talk all the time and when i wanted to speak they say that i m not being very considerate of their emotions it s just too toxic to ignore and you either have to bring it up the the friend or just leave it it s not worth the pain\n",
            "this lockdown has brought into sharp focus those people that are important in my life and those that aren t the ones that you think to reach out to are important to you the ones that reach out to you show you that you are important to them my list is very small very small but that s ok my focus is on staying healthy and safe and once this whole thing is behind us i will know who really wants to be part of my life\n",
            "my mother taught me this unfortunately years ago i was a single mum who was pretty poor and i had a phone which was incoming only my mum who i must say was abusive to me and my siblings insisted that i go to the phone box to call her despite the fact she had a usable phone with a plan of free local calls for years i would call her using money i didn t have and not once did she call me i suddenly realized that she never once checked in on me and there was zero reason why she couldn t so i stopped calling her and the backlash was awful but i reminded her that yeah she s my mum but i am her daughter with two of her grandchildren i still felt bad for not calling her but she didn t seem to care about how we all were\n",
            "every time i feel a close friendship fading i straightforwardly ask them why in an honest non accusing way a heart to heart talk somehow they always end up playing the victim and make it look like it was my fault we stopped talking in the 1st place when in reality i was the one who made 100 of the effort asked questions sent pics vids and just gave them a shoulder to lean cry on when nobody else would all for little to nothing i d give anything to have people like that in my life tbh effort shows that they at least care some friendships are like rope the tighter you hold it the more you hold on to it the more damage it does it s not worth it tbh\n",
            "i always feel conflicted with this sometimes i feel like i need to someone to talk to and so i reach out but then regret it if they don t bother to keep up with me i have a habit of always being the first to reach out and then always feeling like i m the one who puts all the effort in there s times where i want to reach out but tell myself not to and to just wait and see if the other person will bother i understand that people get busy but there has to be some people who will put that effort back for you right i think some of us have different views and expectations on this and that s what makes it feel worse\n",
            "i m used to feel bad when i care too much for my friend until someday i realize that nobody cares me they chat or call me when they have problem i came for them giving my time to cares and offers help for them but when i have problem i got so frustrated and depressed they never come to me to offer help or even listening to my story i often make status about my problem on instagram or facebook but they just doesn t care i know this because when we meet in campus they are active on instagram for a hour i feel like it s waste of time to defend this toxic friendship 2 5 years being friends in campus i though i m gonna have friend i trust them but in the end they betrayed me now i just want to forget all the time i spent with them\n",
            "what if they stopped checking up on me because i also stopped checking and reaching out to them too funny thing is no one really ever did remember me so it was always just me who always cares all along im just someone worthless\n",
            "the best kinds of relationships are the ones where you never have to worry about who s going to call who or when because you know the love is there\n",
            "constantly but i keep reminding myself friendships aren t transactions maybe i do check up on them more often but maybe they re less resentful than i am when i screw up maybe they ve helped me accept my mental illness and get help maybe they motivated me to work on my dreams etc we don t all bring the same things to the table and although i understand how you feel since i ve been feeling the same way lately i know it doesn t mean i care more than they do besides sometimes you have to tell people what you need even if you think it s obvious and want them to guess call a friend tell them you re down if they listen and comfort you that means much more than how often they take initiative\n",
            "the person might just not know that you need to be checked up on you might think that it s second nature to know to check up on friends because you struggle with mental illness and might need that but to them they might have no clue they re doing anything wrong they probably don t not care they could just not realize that they re not doing something you want them to be doing i don t know the exact case that you re dealing with but they can t read your mind you know\n",
            "my youngest sibling called my dad from college it made my dad very happy and he said she was the only child to call him from college i felt horrible for months wondering why i never called my dad then i realized he never called me either\n",
            "sometimes i hope my other friends are doing good on their own but it s often friends over time just don t talk as much and that gets said they come and go in some cases i would still persist past that though it comes down to if you would still care about somebody even if they didn t care about you and my answer is always you should\n",
            "after i finished school and went to uni this was the mindset i had no one was getting in touch with me from school so why would i contact them i decided not to initiate conversation with anyone for a week a week went by and i didnt hear from most people just close family occasionally and a couple of people who would sometimes contact me first a month went by and for the most part still nothing i deleted my fb pretty much losing contact with everyone i fuckin knew i had the mindset of well fuck em if they dont want to initiate anything with me then i dont with them i thought everyone just thought they were too good for me or they have people theyd rather chat to i realised properly at the start of this year i finished 3rd year of uni last summer i had just shot myself in the foot big time i had nothing else to lose and was depressed af and decided to reach out to one of my best mates from school he d had an awful thing happen in his life at uni that i didnt know about and after talking to him for a bit i realised he was in exactly the same situation as me he didnt think people were bothered about staying in touch so he never reached out doing this changed my mindset a lot if i see someone i know or know of in public i will make sure im the one to approach them and engage in conversation i will initiate conversations on social media with old friends and usually the people are very happy to hear from you sorry for the long comment the post just hit me in the feels because its understandable to feel how you do about it as i did but i guess you have to remember they are only human and they have feelings too which maybe similar or even worse than yours im pretty sure this old friend of mine would not have ever got in touch with me if i hadn t with him but its not because he didnt care deep down i guess he just thought i didnt care enough to get in touch with him so he felt he shouldnt care either and never bothered\n",
            "just realized this the other day i had a list of people i hadn t checked up on since all the coronavirus stuff started and i felt like they must be sitting around thinking why isn t iamjackvane seeing how i am these days and then i realized i hadn t thought that once about a single one of my friends who hadn t reached out to me\n",
            "i have had this very thought many many times but one thing my psychiatrist said really stuck with me he told me that it s okay for me to reach out to people because how can they support me if i don t reach out and if they don t reciprocate then i don t need those kind of people in my life but he was right the fear of rejection or being seen as too needy made me self isolate so now if i wanna reach out to someone i do i ve messaged people on instagram or fb just saying hey i m thinking of you and wishing you well or even randomly texted people that i haven t spoken to in a while because something reminds me of them so yes the phone works both ways but if you wanna call then call don t worry about when the last time you spoke or when s the last time they called you go for it\n",
            "this is so accurate it s painful i know i am bad at initiating conversation but i rarely hear from people unless they need something it becomes a vicious cycle especially when i m in a depressive state i m not hearing from this person because they don t actually give a sh t so i won t text them first because they don t want to hear from me\n",
            "eventually we ended becoming strangers once more it s sad cause whenever i check on people they make it like i was a bother to them when in reality i genuinely care for their well being as a whole and when it comes to me yeah i m forgotten by those i really care about so i just gave up no point in trying at all anymore\n",
            "for years i ve been thinking about these well more like worrying mortifying myself in my experience some people get angry my worst fear some take it easy and some just forget or don t need to be often in contact to have a friendship for example wanna call just call don t think too much about it and be frontal with that other person on what you think about this\n",
            "i ve felt the same way i would feel bad for not talking to my friends in a while and slowly got to the point where i realized that if i don t initiate contact then nobody ever messages or calls me so i decided to do an experiment last september and stop initiating contact and now i just feel like nobody really cares as much about me as i did them i m still struggling with it tbh cuz now i just feel alone and neglected it doesn t help that i m fairly anti social and don t really go out much or put myself in an environment to meet new people i ve always been on the really shy side so when the people i care about don t even bother to check up on me i just feel like a part of myself has been stomped on and why should i even try anymore sorry i just kinda took the opportunity to vent a little here but i guess in a way i can say that your not alone in feeling the way you do there s more of us out here going through something similar hopefully we ll eventually find people that care to check up on us stay well and i wish you good luck\n",
            "they ll probably laugh at one of my jokes have their happy time and then they would get busy with their lives so yes we talked but it s like it didn t make any difference and even if you speak out your depressing stuff to them how long is it going to be bearable for them does this stuff interest anyone so what s the point of talking if there s no good i can do to myself rather ruin someone else s day too\n",
            "i m going against the grain here but i view it in the opposite way if i am feeling hurt that someone has not checked up on me i remind myself that the phone goes both ways then i text them because let s face it i ve still got issues\n",
            "i used to think i was bothering or annoying people just by simply talking to them maybe i did bother people every now then but not all the time but then i realised that even though they always said i m not bothering or annoying them i was always the one to start conversations over messages or it would be me going to them if we met up to talk or drink when i realised i stopped putting the effort in i dont talk to or even see most people now and finally realised who my friends are and who in my family actually cares yeah it s hard realising that i only really have 3 friends 1 i live with but it s a lot better knowing at least 1 person cares about you instead of thinking no one does\n",
            "i have a friend that i call and text occasionally we use to be close she claims that she has sent me multiple texts and phone calls and i never respond i ve had the same phone number since my 24 year old was a baby\n",
            "this happened a lot to me in fact with almost everyone even just making conversation by text i would always be the person to start it\n",
            "oh yes most definitely after literal years of feeling bad because we rarely talked i always had to be the one to contact him which eventually made me convince myself that he hated me so i just stopped contacting him at all i finally contacted my old best friend again and put all the cards on the table explained how hurt i was and how for my own mental health i had to have him back in my life or out of it completely he told me he had no idea i felt this way and he would be sad to have me out of his life since we d been close friends ever since we started school up until we were about 15 ish and said that he would try to keep more in contact with me that lasted for a couple of weeks and everything is as it s been for the past few years it still hurts a lot but it hurts a bit less this time around however i only think that s because i have lowkey started to resent him for all the pain he s put me through even though he didn t do it intentionally sorry for bursting into rant that just hit close to home\n",
            "typical blame game in the end i have a friend like that i wonder how hes doing a lot of the time the reason he s not checkinh up on me might just be because i m not chrcking up on him making him feel bad there s a very dark end to leading someone on so we should know better let s not childishly play this blame game and acknowledge that both sides are doing something terribly wrong in such a relationship\n",
            "if we both dont check up on each other than who fucking are we as a people\n",
            "i fear that this could happen to me at times it feels as if this would happen to me\n",
            "but you re right the phone does go both ways and you re not checking on them if you were always checking on them but not the other way round then what you say would be fair but if neither of you are then you have no more right to be mad at them not checking on you than they have to be mad at you for not checking on them\n",
            "i ve tried being that way and always felt like it just made things worse it might not always make sense but i ve found that trying to be the type of person i wish i had leaves a lot less to be mad at i m broken no one really cares and i ve accepted that it doesn t mean that i can t at least try to put better things in the world\n",
            "all the time people rarely initiate either me i d really like to find someone who would\n",
            "yes i would text people but they d never make any effort to text me so i just stopped now whenever i say smth like we never talk any more or you don t text me they say well you don t text me either and then i think it s my fault it probably is my fault\n",
            "yeah me and my ex both are suffering from severe depression he doesnt use his phone much where as i use it constantly so i would always feel like i wasn t cared for or lack of reciprocation when he just wasn t one of those people\n",
            "i used to call people all the time i decided to see if they would call me if i did not call them not many did\n",
            "well maybe they feel the same way about you maybe try to check on them at least once and if they don t check on you ever again you know your answer\n",
            "this is most of my relationships tbh then i always get told that i should make an effort and it s like nah no energy for more of those relationships\n",
            "this is how i ve been feeling since we all had to go home for quarantine suddenly everyone has disappeared\n",
            "i some point in my life i just fell off for a couple week and waited for anyone and everyone to text or call me a few did so i came back to them but not even some family members checked up on me i dropped them and friends and they have the audacity of saying i don t talk to them\n",
            "no i don t take offense when they don t check up on me because i find it difficult to check up on them myself and they know this i m antisocial as fuck and asocial i m an extremely low maintenance friend\n",
            "i feel this and actually it describes how relationships are with me too depressing as hell i can barely connect with anyone meanwhile empathy also sucks the life out of me haha\n",
            "i never really think of it that way but that s a good point i always guilt trip myself so much they re doing the same thing\n",
            "i don t feel bad for not checking in with people anymore if they want me in their lives they ll reach out i shouldn t have to be the only one doing it\n",
            "yes this happens to me all the time even if it s just for holidays i m the type of person who always checks on my friends especially since the quarantine but it s never given back or it is but very rarely it s pretty annoying at times because i feel like i m over invested if that makes sense like i m always checking up on my older cousin because she s been having a tough time during the quarantine and she also has own mental health problems that she deals with and i help her a lot but i feel like it s not really returned or she doesn t care as much as i do even with the holidays i m always the first one to wish those who i check up on and this past easter i didn t wish the same cousin happy easter because i just wanted to see what would happen and just as expected nothing happened i ended up wishing her happy easter late at night because i felt bad i want to stop caring as much as i do because it s pretty clear people aren t always going to do the same but i can t help it because i know how much it sucks not having someone there i m in a pickle too\n",
            "yeah i know too much this feeling i m close friend with 6 persons and i m the only one who always ask how they re but they never ask me back but this becomes normal now it s been 2 years now this is life and life isn t fair\n",
            "i recently felt all depressed because i m always checking up on someone i really care about but she doesn t ever hit me up to ask how i m doing idk total opposite i guess but the phone does go both ways it s starting to feel like i m just bugging now\n",
            "exactly what i m dealing with he hasn t asked me how i was feeling in weeks when i ask everyday\n",
            "yes i always think about this like i think i definitely lack social skills that i didn t gain as a child and now i tend to not know how to keep a friendship going so i don t really speak to anyone when i depart my separate ways from think like when school is out and everyone goes back home etc but then i remember that they could have also been talking to me this whole time too if they cared about me\n",
            "trust me i get it i am 19f and my father moved out of the country we hardly communicate now we have spoken once on the phone in the last four months which is nothing compared to how it was prior to the move i used to chat with my father on a daily basis and i lived with him all of that changed when he left and moved out of the country i slipped into a depression that no one understood i was mad and upset that my own father wouldn t try and call or message me but when i expressed such moods to him he told me the the phone works both ways he said i should put in the effort as well and try to communicate with him and that is not a one way road at this point i have accepted his decision that he moved away and i need to grow up but it was a long and hurtful process\n",
            "i agree i feel so full of hatred because i had no one to talk to i want to say something but it doesn t feel right i want help but want to keep my friends out of it nobody really cares unless i say something and put them in a place where they have to\n",
            "i don t care to check up on people i know when they have any minor problems in life whether it be a fight or a anxiety break down they ll come to me to vent i also know them well enough that if i ever tried to do the same to them they d huff and act like i was being over dramatic so i m not really that surprised that they don t check up on me\n",
            "i feel this i ve got bipolar depression and so reaching out to others is beyond difficult my mother always insists on me having to call my relatives to check in but no one ever thinks to call me drives me nuts\n",
            "i check up on my friends a lot i hear about their depression their worries and i let them vent to me about anything and everything i try to be supportive and give the best advice i can as soon as possible if i ever look for help i ll get ignored i ll be left on read or be told that they just didn t have the time or weren t in the mood to handle me i understand that some people aren t always ready to support someone but it always seems to be that no one is ever ready to help me people seem to use me to vent and then forget i exist when i have problems\n",
            "dude i know how you feel i haven t heard from my best friend since december i just kinda said fuck it if he wants to get a hold of me he will he knows where i live don t get me wrong i feel awful for getting to this point but i feel like i was the one always tryna make the effort to hang out maybe i said something to piss him off at me or something or he s just got other things going on in his life that doesn t need me involved whichever the case at this point yes i feel bad but he s got his own things too\n",
            "yes all the time with the exception of my best friend i am always the one to initiate conversations or checking in on others\n",
            "i check up many of my friends but i m also very messed up and wish someone just asked me how i m going or how i am i have tried not saying anything to anyone and i would not get any messages from anyone it s kinda sad\n",
            "i feel this on a whole other level you have no idea it was definitely worse when all my friends went away to college and i stayed home you ll learn in time that the people who wanna be around you and in your life will make the time and effort to stay in touch\n",
            "i haven t talked to my dad in almost four years cause i fell into a depression and didn t call him for a while like i normally would have and then he never called me either and we never spoke again\n",
            "whenever someone stops talking to me in the middle of them checking up on me which is honestly fucking rare i always get the feeling that they don t care it makes me incredibly angry lmao\n",
            "people have to focus on themselves and their own health first and have their own shit going on both of which i totally get but i agree it s nice to see someone s name pop up on your phone screen i just deactivated my facebook account today for mental health reasons and i already feel better i m a 25 year old guy and i got sick of opening the app and seeing pictures political rants and other shit i don t really care about from hundreds of people as harsh as it sounds if people really care enough about me they have my number snapchat and instagram to check up on me i reserve my snap for people i talk to and hang out with outside of social media insta is more for acquaintances and a wider audience my phone number is somewhere in the middle\n",
            "yep then i get vilified for not calling hurts to have to get people like that out of your life but that s toxic and sucks when they re family and the only link you have left to your recently deceased father like in my situation but yes phones can call both ways communication is a two way thing\n",
            "i think everyone feels this way it can be good to break that stalemate if someone was always checking in on you wouldn t it make it a lot easier for you to check in on them i get the frustration i feel it too there are a lot of friendships that have faded because i never thought to reach out to them because they weren t talking to me either i feel worse because of it and i have never felt bad from being the one reaching out and sometimes they might really need it personally i think it s worth trying\n",
            "nah the use of my phone is playing games now and not for calling or texting someone because no one s bother to reply or calls back i ll just wasting my money and hurting my self emotionally\n",
            "what is our delusion what are we hiding from ourselves where we open our hearts more be more compassionate to all beings have less reciprocal expectations less co dependent relationships this is where we find freedom and self worth when we can dismiss the part of our personality that is protecting our ego from the pain of being in this human experience we become more vulnerable more aware wiser you are never alone as we are all one\n",
            "i ve got that but backwards feeling down cuz nobody checks up and feeling guilty for feeling down when i know i also don t reach out so my feeling bad is my own fault my grandma is the only one who checks in on me other than my husband her random little happy monday s mean so much to me and she s probably the only person i feel like i can text when i feel like i just need a little human contact with a simple happy thursday sorry it took me so long to get back to you how have things been\n",
            "there s a lovecraft book called celephais and its about a man who spends all his money to spend his life in sleep and dreaming rather than in reality it s an interesting read and sometimes i feel like following suit\n",
            "yeah i hate those so much and especially when you wake up disappointed and upset it wasn t real\n",
            "that feel when you try to wake up from a nightmare only to realize you re awake\n",
            "worst fucking thing ever when you re actually happy and u feel good and then wake up and realize it was just your imagination and you re back to being a sad fuck\n",
            "part of the reason i smoke weed so often stops me dreaming so much but my god when you stop smoking you get some crazy ass dreams\n",
            "i used to dream about a girl i was friends with in high school pretty often for years after graduating then i ran into her one day and she claimed she didn t remember me stopped those dreams real quick\n",
            "man i feel you i constantly dream about me succeeding and having a wife then suddenly waking up and realizing my life is light years behind from that\n",
            "i can feel affection enjoyment and satisfaction that i m unable to feel irl anhedonia suicide is on the table for the future because of this so many people are able to take the ability to feel pleasurable emotions for granted\n",
            "i even like stressful dreams because they help me forget myself for a short time anything is better than the full grey shitshow of reality\n",
            "you believe me if i tell you that since i had chronic depression with some anxiety i couldn t even dream probably not but it s true maybe was the medication i thought about this for a long time i wasn t able to think properly it was hard to even think in something and get me focused in i needed to push myself into thinking about to say something to someone in a way to not be judged i was more an observer only even now that i m better and i believe i left the depression i can t remember my last dream now i have more like lucid objectives and a vision while awake my english is improving i believe but it s not the best\n",
            "one time i had a dream that i was cooking myself my favorite food when this boy walked up behind me and gave me a hug i felt so loved and safe it was a really vivid dream too i even remember his breath on my neck as he hugged me i sadly don t remember that much about who the boy was just that he had green and blue hair for some reason i woke up feeling so empty and disappointed because i hadn t had a real hug in months or even any contact with anyone else i tried falling asleep and going back to that dream but it didn t work since then i ve had one other dream with him in it and it was when we were walking down a dark corridor and i was following him holding his hand i couldn t seem to get a good look at his face like it was familiar but it kept changing the more i looked at it i must ve started crying somewhere in my dream because i woke up with a stuffy nose and my eyes felt like i d been crying sorry for going on about these dreams i ve had they just really had an impact on me\n",
            "i dream of a few years ago when i had all my friends and i was happy and loving life then i wake up and realize that nothing matters and i just want to skip into nothingness\n",
            "yep i ve been having a lot more of these recently for some reason and it makes me want to die\n",
            "totally man like i always used to dream about topping a national exam worked hard but the constant delations due to corona are fkin my mind up still i had hope now there was this girl with whom i silently used to compete with w o showing actually that i did we didn t talk for 2 months due to some small fight my ego prblms tbh tho m an as hole now both of us gave an online mock today i gave early like i completed 5 hrs before she started then i told her to start then i waited for 8 hrs wasting shit hoping that she wud score lesser he s an asshole confirmed now just 5 mins ago she finished and she fkin topped it while i was 4th 2 fkin months she told me she didnt study shit in this whole time she doesn t lie and even tho how much i studied i couldnt even be near her i feel like killing myself i am a anti social idiot who s sociality is to a lil extent only displayed on the internet w o good scores i am nothing and it seems like i will never improve and will remain nothing forever until i die of depression\n",
            "yes fuck those dreams i hate waking up pro tip if you smoke enough weed all day and night you wont have dreams anymore kinda a bad give and take there but hey it works lol\n",
            "literally made a post on this yesterday i feel you it s like everyone is trying to remind me even myself\n",
            "i feel this so much i was recently trying to explain this to a friend who didnt seem to get it\n",
            "yea it really sucks especially if the dream is something you always wanted like the other day my dream isn t exactly something i could possibly say on here for its a nsfw one\n",
            "everytime when i m dreaming and things are going well i wake up because i know it s not real\n",
            "i have nightmares most of the time all of my dreams are always extremely vivid but i always feel like i d rather have the nightmares over the good dreams because at least with nightmares i wake up feeling the same as i always do but with good dreams i wake up with even more disappointment and anxiety and it just makes me severely depressed\n",
            "this is precisely why i don t try to train lucid dreaming i know i d wind up doing everything i could to stay asleep with my dreams\n",
            "ever have that dream about someone you ve never met and then meet that person that s happened to me but if i tried introducing myself the person always turned out to not be like the dream weird huh\n",
            "last night i had a dream that me and the cast of impractical jokers were made slaves to this lady who owned a pet store she also made me her sex slave but demoted me and made murr her new one so i just had to do normal pet store jobs so i can kind of relate\n",
            "yeah hell sure that and it gets more disappointing with thought that the same brain is hurt all time of day but during night it throws us in the pit of self importance\n",
            "same i hate the dreams where i feel like some one is really happy to see me where some one loves me i wake up and just want to die\n",
            "i had a blissful dream that i reunited with my ex and had the conversation i had always hoped we would have i finally felt the void i d been carrying for 8 months was gone and back in his arms everything was perfect for what felt like an hour i woke up to my phone ringing my mom wasn t coming to visit me as had been planned her 2nd time canceling a trip she proceeded to cry on the phone to me about her other problems which led to me comforting her though i felt betrayed by her nonexistent need to ever visit me and her selfishness while it validated my feeling that i ve been raising her all these years mothering her minutes later a law firm called the firm rejected to take on my case against a couple who s dog attacked me while i was walking it they denied it because i was hired to walk the dog and there was some complications with the fact i was in charge of the time the dog attacked me which sent me to go to the hospital it sounded like b s at that time i had already been diagnosed with depression i couldn t find the motivation to call a lawyer for more than a year and never went for further treatment for my arm which was against doctors advice i finally gathered the motivation to make the call spent a week waiting and now i was denied that was the phone call i can t describe the mood i felt having felt those really serene peaceful and perfect moments and then waking up to reality audibly reminding me of my issues but i m not giving up fighting to get out of this deep dark warped mindset i m cleaning right now trying to stay active i m still extremely dependent on marijuana to feel ok in my free time and i just spent an hour crying over a movie that triggered my feelings of loneliness but i m still trying\n",
            "either i have night terrors or my good dreams end with some weird painful incredibly specific deception that only my brain could conjure against me\n",

            "i hate dreams in general all mine are usually nightmares but i relate to what you are saying because all the good ones i have are a big slap in the face those dreams that are realistically pleasant are just something i can never have or truly experience in real life\n",
            "i find some sort of hope and comfort in them at least there i can get what i never had completely in real life\n",
            "i don t know about you but i like them they re comforting for me in a weird way\n",
            "i know what you mean worst is when you dream of people you love and know and when you wake up you realise i am alone\n",
            "i love these dreams i often try to go back to sleep to experience it again i crave it i know i don t often get to experience love or happiness in my real life my favorite dreams are where i am having a nice romantic date or fun time hanging out with a close friend i know it sounds weird but i appreciate the real life experiences of when i am in love or happy more\n",
            "i actually feel different about these type of dreams for me a lonely and hopeless romantic it makes me feel as if i finally have the love i ve been longing for all these years when i wake up i feel as if i had a wonderfully romantic night with a dream guy i wish i had them moreso then i wouldn t feel so lonely when i m awake but they only happen once in a blue moon for me unfortunately\n",
            "tell me about it i dreamt about a love i will never have the other night talk about waking up miserable\n",
            "i hate them too but i try to appreciate the time i spent in the dream rather than feeling sad it ended\n",
            "hey if the dream is about you meeting your waifu all i say it s pretty good lovely i ll wake up with a smile on my face more determination to change myself\n",
            "i feel your pain my recurring dream for nearly 10 years is finding someone i really like at a hotel having a conversation by the stairs smiling at each other the whole nine yards i wake up with an immense feeling of sadness\n",

            "just had one of those the other day and i ve been dropping into one of my low states lately\n",
            "i used to feel like this all the time i m not in the best place right now either i m in a pretty bad rut and life circumstances are ass right now and covid and family cancer just makes it worse but now that i m older i ve seen that those good dreams that show you those good feelings aren t showing you things you could never have they re showing you emotions you re capable of experiencing in a different mind state situation and experience when i had that realization it helped me a lot\n",
            "omg someone finally said it and after we wake up does anyone else feel an emptiness inside them like literally as if they were whole in the dream and now they are missing something\n",
            "my meds cause me to have vivid dreams and it can definitely suck i usually have to lie in bed a bit after waking up just to readjust to reality\n",
            "i love it while i am in my dream but it leaves a longing feeling once i wake up\n",
            "yo at this point the most interesting part of my days are my dreams and it s so shitty thinking back to something that happened in my dream and wondering if that was real life or not\n",
            "i ve had so much deja vu and so many night terrors where i wake up in my dream and i m still dreaming thats it s hard to distinguish what is real when i wake up maybe the waking world isn t a dream but it sure is nice knowing what is real\n",
            "i ve found myself in my head a lot daydreaming i guess having imaginary conversations with someone who doesn t actually care about me i ll be genuinely happy and smiling until i remember none of it s real\n",
            "the dreams are proof of the possibility that you can have such a feeling and soon you can have it in reality also it s open\n",
            "the exact same thing happened to me a while ago i dreamed that i had a friend who hugged me while i cried and comforted me when i said i don t want to live anymore and strangely i felt comfortable telling him that it was amazing only to have it all come crashing when i woke up\n",
            "i was dating my crush in a dream then i woke up crying for like 20minutes\n",
            "a chilling line i remember from the movie the road is viggo s character saying when you start having happy nostalgic dreams it means you ve given up basically if you still have fucked up dreams about the apocalypse then you re still fighting don t really believe that in real life but it s very interesting\n",
            "i literally just woke up from a dream that made me feel that way and i feel you man\n",
            "i ve had dreams especially during depressive episodes where i lived these fantastic lives and had everything i could ever hope for and they d always enc up with my heart do full and happy only to be dashed against the rocks of reality and broken into a million pieces because dammit why can t i just have those good things happen in my life but i m forging a new way for myself no family maybe a husband but mostly just fulfilling my calling that s exciting and terrifying to me i try to focus on that\n",
            "you ever have those super realistic dreams where you re dating someone you know and it turns out to be a very functional and happy relationship and it s so realistic that when you wake up you initially go to text them but realize that your love for them was only in a dream and you won t be able to have any of that happiness as long as you re awake\n",
            "if you think you think the same in dream as when you are awaken thats already some self esteem\n",
            "what about dreams were you are about to die or have just died but then you wake up and realizer you re still alive\n",
            "you re not alone i often have a dream about my ex whom broke up with me last year she and i were so happy in the dreams like we used to be together but as long as i wake up i felt frustrated that ruins my day those dreams about her weren t always happy but they annoyed me just the same and there was once i wanted so much to ask her in my dream if i was a joke to her how i wish i can just stop having these dreams\n",
            "i feel you the few dreams i have that i remember when i wake are usually of an alternate me who is a happy relationahip and everything is peachy picture perfect sometimes theres sex that feels so real i actually believe it then i wake up and say good morning to my silver bullet the only thing in life thats always a click a clack and a pull away\n",
            "i was about to post about the same thing it really gives me suicidal thoughts especially when i live in a place where i cant do anything that i dream of i really feel you\n",
            "it makes it so hard to be able to wake up in the morning knowing you cant come back to that\n",
            "daydreming hurts but it also gives you that slither of hope like you can do then it all goes away and you feel all the pain and shame you did at first\n",
            "yeah i understand completely i had this one dream where i was in a university dorm and after classes i would go home and there waiting for me was my crush and we just sat on the sofa and chilled and enjoyed each others company i feel like that isn t gonna happen at all\n",
            "i had a dream once i don t really know what it was about but i remember feeling so happy and loved then i woke up that shit hurt\n",
            "it s one of the worst things i have ever experienced i feel you so much i recently had a dream every night for almost a week by now where i was in a relationship with a girl that serves in the same staff as i do in the army she s quite the bitchy woman yet kinda sweet really fucking beautiful and attractive but she isn t my type ugh and in these dreams me and her were deeply in love with each other and so happy to be together and it just serves to confuse the heck out of me even more making me think wait do i really want her and it just drives the whole idea of i can t get someone to want to be close to me further in like a knife to my heart\n",
            "this i had two dreams last night where i was in a loving relationship and it really screwed me over for the whole day\n",
            "i just get nightmares that make me terrified and hate life anymore anxiety sure is fun\n",
            "this comment is coming in late but i also hate those dreams i also hate the moment where i do feel happy for a few hours because in no time all of that is gonna go right back to the cloudy dark rainy days that i m used to\n",
            "all of my dreams used to be the same kind everyone gets the weird nonsensical stuff now most of my dreams are just me being held closely by someone or having someone sit down with me and tell me why they care about me\n",
            "i ve heard it s actually a sign of wanting security it s not home in the physical sense but home in that you want to be somewhere that you feel safe and loved and wanted edit thanks for the silver i hope one day everyone who s connecting with this can find their home some day soon\n",
            "i ve been like this since i was 15 it probably was an early sign of depression i said it out loud so often that if was a joke to my family and friends like why do you like home so much what are you hiding in your room then the thought slowly changed from i just wanna go home to i just want to die but yeah totally understand what you re saying\n",
            "holy crap i ve been in a bad place mentally for a while now i am home a nice comfortable cozy house all of the time and yet i find myself thinking all the time i just want to go home like i m there i so get this\n",
            "are you happy with the person you are wherever you go there you are you know\n",
            "yes i have a theory i still live in the same room i grew up in i m twenty five and since the day i turned 18 i ve been trying to move out when i was younger i had money saved had a job and generally had motivation my parents told me because they were paying my way through college i had to live at home while i wasn t there so they knew they weren t wasting money well college took much longer than expected add cocaine addiction to it and now i m broke so i don t have anywhere else to go i stopped coke years ago but the money situation hardly changed depression hits hard often so i can never hold down a job for more than a few weeks i really liked my last 3 jobs and i lost them all due to breakdowns keeping me out of work finally finished my degree like 3 days ago and had the feeling of holy shit i can move on now the obligation is over and this house reminds me of so much trauma i m going to improve vastly when i can sleep somewhere that isn t this room well like every night in my room i pop pills to fall asleep i wake up depressed having forgot all about my ideas the night before my room although it causes me anxiety it at least helps me get out of bed as the fear is less appealing the more i think about a shower i think it had maybe been four days since i finished my degree it s a funny thing being aware of the ability to move on and letting it wash over you as if it s closer to a dream i want to move on from this place but first school now first my addiction now first getting therapy now first etc every so often we can t escape the mental box we ve created to keep us comfortable i feel this in a physical sense as well as i m sure you do escaping a mental place of comfort leads to growth so it should appear these physical places of comfort however seem like a necessary bastion and without them we can feel so drained without a home base to let our gaurd down becoming uncomfortable in my room was the first step to doing something about it so i m working a bit not much i see a therapist i look for new better jobs i think i will become mentally comfortable with this struggle until i consider my freedom i can hardly sleep anywhere but this room and i can hardly sleep in this room no revelations i think things will stay this way untill i grow up in a sense i have scary responsibilities in my future i think i ll find my own home when the time is right it feel like the years passing me by tells the story of someone who can move on but is simply choosing not to selfishly indulging in what makes me feel week and unable is a good way to avoid responsibility that isn t what i want today like every day i need to pop a pill to go to sleep so i guess today i stay awake maybe tomorrow when i normally lay in bed and feel sorry i will remember that i can do something about it yeah i wanna go home i m glad i found home within myself i hope it gives me the strength to make the million small steps to finding my own place i think i can do it were humans feeling discomfort so there must be something to be done\n",
            "yes almost everyday i feel like a stranger but i ve lived in the same house for six years and the same area my whole life i don t think i ever felt at home since i was a child\n",
            "i ve said that all my life when things got hard i want to go home i think i want to go someplace where i feel safe loved and at peace somewhere people are nice and things are easy i ve never been anywhere like that but seems like it would be nice\n",
            "damn this is too true my room was always been my sanctuary from age 7 to 19 and then i had a couple months to pack whilst being a full time student on the quarter system work is now my most stable place it s a tiny ass business so the pandemic has only added fun to that i think it s a song by afi but home is nowhere it comes to mind also home by three days grace nowhere really feels safe the world already felt incompatible but now i don t know where do i come from where do i go nowhere across the country in isolation heck if i know i hope you find somewhere you feel comfortable op do you have an ideal tangible content place those places can seem so far away but weird occurrences can pop out of nowhere you re included in the group of people that may have good things even happiness happen to them even though it may not feel like it wish you well\n",
            "i get this completely home is a feeling not a place i ve lived alone for a long time and so everything around me in my apartment is pretty much exactly as i want it and i am extremely grateful for that but i still sometimes get this feeling of alienation and discomfort i think home is a state of mind and sometimes i just can t get there no matter how much my surroundings match my aesthetic preferences\n",
            "omg this happens to me on the daily it s like no matter where i am my home or out i don t feel like any place makes me feel like i can completely be me\n",
            "for me this happens whenever i m not feeling good be it because of general depression some arguement or any other issue in life i don t get the peace i need anywhere my cozy nook doesn t feel cozy anymore nothing gets me the peace i need i somehow understand somewhat in those times why people are led to suicide\n",
            "whenever i think i want to go home i think about my childhood home i haven t lived there for around 26 years\n",
            "i foolishly decided to move back in with my parents because of covid and my college graduation i thought i was homesick and now it turns i m homesick for a place i don t even know exists just yet\n",
            "i feel this so hard but i know where my home is it s in the earth in caves in dirt in mud sometimes even just a a clay mask makes me feel better out digging in the garden i don t bother with shovels or gloves not even shoes i just bury myself in the earth that is my home for others it s the ocean or bodies of water a bath a shower for some it may be fire or wind i ve known people where it s not an element but a smell or a colour like old books or just shades of green in some cases it s even a person but this one is more uncommon in us folk the depression bois i ve found you can find your home you ll know it when you find it\n",
            "yep while homeless a few times when i woke up and had it in my head that i had a home to go to it was funny and comforting and not as depressing as it sounds shelter is not everything a home can be a jail i ve rarely felt more free then some moments on the streets\n",
            "i am healthy i am whole but i have poor impulse control and i want to go home but i am home is actually a the mountain goats line i like quite a bit so it s a pretty common feeling to have i ve been both homeless and in a home that i felt wasn t actually mine and honestly while having a home is infinitly better for you know convenience purposes sometimes i felt at least in charge of my own life when i didn t have it they both suck and you re allowed to feel that it sucks you just gotta find the things that can replace that home whether it s people or just somewhere you feel safe\n",
            "i feel this so much right now i have several places to live but none of them are home i don t have a set bed that feels like home anymore and it s sad\n",
            "i know the feeling all too well that was me when i lived with my parents i was absolutely miserable i enjoy time with my partner in our apartment appreciate it but some days i just can t get out of bed and hate where i m at\n",
            "i want to go home is one of my most frequent intrusive thoughts when i m really down echoes obsessively in my head sometimes i can t hear anything else it seems so loud i think it s my brain wishing i felt comfortable and safe\n",
            "mhmm so much lately in my room having a panic attack and all i can think in my head is i want to go home i never understand it\n",
            "i don t think the home we all refer to when we say that is here at least i know that s how it is for me like i know earth is just a temporary stay like a boarding school you never wanted to attend\n",
            "yeah where you live isn t always home we all have that place where we feel at home for me it s spain and specially my village where my great grandma had a house everywhere else i just feel like i m part of the machine working away day by day not really going anywhere\n",
            "i have felt this way for more than 5 years after moving between my home state and another state and then to a new country i ve felt truly at home in none of those places and maybe haven t felt it since i was a kid home isn t a place it s a feeling in my life i ve found it to be a rare one yet the lack of the feeling can be one of the most painful things in the world\n",
            "yeah when i lived alone i always get that alien feeling when i m away from family ironically even when i m still sad at home\n",
            "i ve felt like this when i get really depressed for me it s a feeling of not having anyone to confide in or lean on and wanting someone to feel like home for me\n",
            "a house is not a home and that is something that more and more people need to understand and you are absolutely 100 ok to feel this way people think that plucking anyone off the street and sticking them within 4 walls is good enough they say that people should be grateful for what they have they blame people who aren t successful in maintaining their housing because if they didn t want to be homeless they wouldn t have ruined that opportunity but a house is not automatically a home a home involves walls sure and a roof but a home is also security it is the trust and reassurance that your possessions and you yourself are safe and protected within those walls a home is also belonging it is the understanding that the space belongs to you and that you belong in the space sometimes that feeling comes from living with friends or family sometimes that comes from buying your own place sometimes it comes from just making it your own but simply being placed in a building does not automatically make you feel at home you said that you haven t had a home for years despite always having a place to stay this kind of sounds to me like you ve maybe around a bit you ve maybe had a few different apartments places or maybe crashed with friends or stayed with family here or there if that s the case i can understand entirely why you wouldn t feel at home do you feel like the places you stay are just temporary like you don t want to really settle in in case you need to leave again i really hope that things can turn around for you and you can find a place that you can truly call home everyone deserves to have a safe space that they can go and just be\n",
            "i m reading this and i know that feeling you describe i realized though i don t have a home i ve never had one i don t ever remember feeling it really i thought something felt like home recently for the first time ever but it turns out i was wrong\n",
            "i experience the same thing kind of i live in my mother s house on the first floor it s my own flat so i pay the bills for half the house and have a separate electricity bill buy my own food pay for my internet etc but i don t feel at home this flat used to be my grandmother s and i moved in when she died because someone had to take care of her dog and cat our dog died shortly after her because of cancer just like her there s still stuff around from her but i m too depressed i have chronic depression for almost 10 years now to get rid of it neither do i have a car half of my belongings are in another flat that s above my other grandmother s house it s complicated i know i used to live in my own flat neither in my mother s nor my grandmother s house and it felt more like home than what i m living in now sorry for my rambling\n",
            "for me i think home is the people you surround yourself with and not the place hell i felt more at home when i would sleep over at a friends house than my house\n",
            "haven t felt at home ever since my mom passed away from breast cancer 15 years ago so i don t think i ll ever feel at home even if i have the rest of my family my fiance and my best friends they make me feel happy and loved which i am truly thankful for but it still makes you feel empty when you know you have someone or something missing\n",
            "always when i m in my boyfriend s house i feel like i m at home i cry coming to my actual house because i live with abusive people it s not even the fact that he has a better house is the fact that he is there when he is in my house i feel at home to because i feel protected\n",
            "i find myself saying i want to go home every single day no matter where i actually am and it means the same thing every time i want the feeling of peace and security and comfort that i had growing up in my childhood home when i was young before depression ever set in\n",
            "for me when i say that i normally mean somewhere comfortable a place where i feel safe secure and that nothing can hurt me\n",
            "yes i get this i used to find refuge here but then someone moved in and it isn t mine anymore and everything is just wrong\n",
            "i m in the army man i live in crappy barracks you have no idea how badly i want to be home\n",
            "everyone wants that feeling of home just because you have shelter etc doesn t mean you re obligated to feel at home lots of people i ve encountered either living with parents or homeless usually share one thing in common they can t find a sense of a home feeling typically caused by a feeling of either missing childhood situations or just feeling out of place from 1 person struggling from depression and finding my own home see what you can do to replicate similar feelings of when you used to feel at home that s the best i can give you since even i myself are trying to seek that\n",
            "these are the actual lyrics to the song riches and wonders by the mountain goats sorry if that s random but music is how i deal with this stuff\n",
            "one of my all time favorite songs linger by stuck out has a line that was a wake up call to me because home isn t a place no it s a state of mind it hits hard because it made me realize that i ll never truly be at home until i feel comfortable and secure\n",
            "ive felt like since i was a little kid i don t think i ve ever said this out loud before but i used to get these horrible migraines just out of nowhere severe throbbing vomiting the whole 9 yards they re a little more mild now which is good but i can still remember that feeling wanting to go home even though i was sitting in my own room the shades shut and every light off trying not to think or move it feels incredibly similar now when i overthink or am just in a dark place i know how you feel op\n",
            "yes fucken always i think its because i only feel like im home when im home alone but idk\n",
            "my wife and i had our dream home in the country i had a job that made me miserable and attempt a few times then covid hit i lost my job and i lost my house my inlaws were kind enough to give us a place to stay but its not home i haven t slept well at all my mental health is a mess and i basically live out of my car because i hate it there fuck i just wanna go home is my mantra lol\n",
            "i sometimes want to believe this is all just a simulation then i can be removed\n",
            "yeah when i was living with my abusive bf and roommates i didn t feel like i was at home and my mental state was bad\n",
            "truthfully you need to get out there more just talking about in general obviously it s not as ideal with the pandemic but you need to step out of your place and mix things up the more you stay inside the more chances your bad thoughts begin to swell up even a simple walk outside does wonders\n",
            "all the time i both moved away from my family home in the states and had my first international trip to europe in the same go i ve been living in germany for 2 years now and i still just sit quietly to myself focusing on how much my body aches to be back home i ve tried so hard to make our my husband and i apartment feel homey but it s not the same and it deeply upsets me no one really tells you how homesickness is a physical sickness as much as an emotional mental one\n",
            "this i ve been doing this for a year now keep your head up op your not alone\n",
            "i don t feel at home anymore i don t know where my home is and i feel very lost i live with my family but i feel like i m not safe here ever since they abruptly discontinued my medication antidepressants are just so expensive besides why would a father spend much money on an attention seeking son i think it s better for the son to disappear so there is more money to the family less mouth to feed indeed\n",
            "quite often because home is a feeling moving countries certainly didn t help because i don t feel at home in my old country nor do i feel at home here it sucks\n",
            "i ve been in my house ever since i was born and i still think i want to go home\n",
            "i want to go home said to myself while bundled up in blankets in my bed\n",
            "yes i have felt that on a few occasions though i ve found it to be more like wishing i was home again as in younger and in my parent s house for me it all comes from things i wish i had done differently on another note my youngest sister had felt the same way and expressed the wish vocally from a young age never having lived anywhere but home she could never explain or describe what home was to her she passed away two years ago this coming february\n",
            "feeling it now more than ever i ve heard it described as being homesick for a place that may not even exist\n",
            "i ve never lived in a single home since i was 4 i really get that\n",
            "yes because for me home was my mom i lived with her my entire life and when she died it was devastating\n",
            "not until i was working from home 100 of the time i never knew how much i d miss the fact that when i get home i m not at work anymore\n",
            "especially when your body is betraying you and you all locked in apathy home despite it being unhealthy thought is back then when i was a relatively happy child young adult ignorant of my parents being narcissists of course i can t go back there especially with my father being close to dying i m scared i will end up alone\n",
            "yes all the time i would assume it s a defensive mechanism to run away i can t run away from the place i live but i want to i don t know\n",
            "yes every day for years and it s even worse since moving out of my parents house you put it perfectly\n",
            "yea i m living with an abusive sister and my mom won t do anything to stop her but i don t have money to move out i m in college i m saving to get out though i just want my home\n",
            "this happened the other day and i saved it because it made a lot of sense\n",
            "wow i was just thinking something very similar a few days ago my house isn t a home it s just the house where me and my cat live and my daughter comes to visit a few times per year\n",
            "yes and then i think that home no longer exists in the sense that it once did to me\n",
            "i used to have that but since we moved 2 months ago i actually feel very much at home i have no desire to leave this place for a long time for me it was finding having a place i feel safe aka at home somewhere i could really make it all the way i want and i feel the best it s a feeling of security\n",
            "i used to say it all the time especially in the midst of my worst breakdowns as i got older i stopped saying it to myself because the thought of going home would make my feelings worse but not because i was already at home but because i realized that i had never had any place to actually call home i m safe and healthy today but i ve always longed for a place or a feeling i could bring up in my mind that carried with it a sense of belonging i m still waiting\n",
            "the weird thing is that i realized this after my grandparents died i wasnt close with them and i kind of felt slightly uncomfortable in their house it was smaller less entertainment options and stricter than my parents and i didnt really understand to connect with them but that place was clearly a home and the way i mourned them was from the loss of that place my aunt owned it for a while and updated it to rent and then the renters bought it but through that i realized none of the three houses i had lived in as a kid were ones i was as emotionally attached to and thought of as a home it wasnt really quite my home but it was the closest i had to it aside from my parents house but my parents almost actively seemed to engender this idea that no place was a safe place especially my mom she loudly telegraphed her anxiety from her divorce her lack of financial trust in my dad and then eventually when i was a teen and not doing enough to cement my financial future she made it very clear that i wasnt welcome in her house if i wasnt doing enough to contribute but when i did it was never enough she was always projecting her own anxieties onto me and everyone else expecting us to take them away it was our house when she was a stay at home mom but when she got a job and dad was unemployed it was suddenly her house and still is even when everyone has a job and contributes financially and she isnt the one paying the mortgage atm the only way she knows how to value herself is in the idea that our family would turn into apes if she stopped taking too much onto herself and then i moved out for a while into sketchy apartment situations with sketchy people and there were other people that were home but they are gone now too so now the prophecy is fulfilled she told me there was no security so now there is no security for me you can t depend on other people i didnt the only home and security i find is in stories in other peoples heads\n",
            "i m so sorry i know what you re going through i ve fallen desperately helplessly in love with my best friend but the man she s been pining for for 15 years came back into her life and she can t choose me over him we re both hurting over losing each other and i feel like i ve lost my home and my safety she isn t my everything but rather my key to everything with her i can be myself i can be happy without crippling self doubt and second guessing and bitterness weighing me down she enables me to be the best person i can be she s my home and i m going to lose that i can t blame her for choosing him and i refuse to she deserves to be happy and waited fifteen fucking years for something this wonderful to finally happen to her she suffered through a miserable abusive marriage and loneliness and disappointment from relationships and suitors that failed to measure up to him convinced she d never see him again she deserves to be happy and i wouldn t love her as helplessly and wholly as i do if i begrudged her that happiness but i m losing my home you re not alone and i m sorry you re feeling this way\n",
            "i ve got a tattoo i wanna go home on the leg and you just perfectly explained his meaning and the feeling that i was thinking of maybe that s because sometimes we ve got the feeling that we re not fitting in this world that somewhere there s a better home where everything seems so much more easy warmful and reassuring\n",
            "i let myself into my dad s house whether he s there or not flick the kettle on see what s in the fridge whereever he has lived has always felt like a home to me this has especially been the case when i ve been living less than happily with ex partners\n",
            "i have but its because i miss my mum and my brother and the better times i cry in bed and just want a hug just not to be alone anymore i want to go home too\n",
            "this is exactly how i feel i always thought i was the only one who felt this way when i get really anxious i alway repeat in my head i wanna go home to me home is just somewhere where i can be carefree and loved\n",
            "i ve realized i say that a lot i wanna go home while i m sitting in my bed\n",
            "although i have had a roof over my over my head just about every day of my life it s been a long time since i ve felt at home currently live with just me and my little dog and it doesn t feel like home\n",
            "agreed i feel like a spoiled brat all the time but i also feel a little deluded and helpless\n",
            "i can relate so much i feel so guilty for being depressed and miserable but i can t open up about it to anyone because there s literally nothing wrong with my life just something went horribly wrong with me\n",
            "same i can hardly tell if i m actually depressed or i m faking it so well i ve fooled myself\n",
            "yep my friends keep asking me why are you depressed you have no hardships in life and i have no idea what to respond also the reason i don t socialize anymore\n",
            "yes and you know you are screwing it you are the real problem you can try be more positive you can try new things or you can just run away but you don t because you know whatever you do wherever you go you will be always you and you will screw everything forever i must say awareness does not help i sometimes wish being able to blame other things\n",
            "legitimately though it all feels so difficult but there s people doing so much more than me i m tired already and this is college people in university are off with tightly packed schedules where they have to do so much more stuff than me physics calculus and here i am struggling to push myself for the smallest things damn it i just need some friends and or a hug\n",
            "other people would fight teeth and nails for the opportunities my parents gave me well they forgot that mental health confidence and selfworth stuff\n",
            "i have lost everything depression can get so much worse alone and on the streets do something do anything to avoid that fate\n",
            "it sucks knowing that depression ruined my life i was a semester away from being a doctor and depression took that away from me now i m back living with my parents unemployed wondering what to do with my life\n",
            "seriously blown through thousands of dollars thousands of my parents money dropped out of school don t get me started\n",
            "if you have depression then it s not easy that s what makes it a disease and not a mood\n",
            "its so nice to hear that other people feel this way too i m so fucking depressed but i feel like i don t have a right to be since there are other people going through so much more shit on paper i ve got it relatively good i just feel fucking miserable all the time it makes me feel so weak and pathetic seeing other people juggle so much more stuff in their lives and i can t even handle my own\n",
            "i know this feeling guilt is a sign of self awareness and humility it s already a step forward accepting that you can do better don t be so hard on yourself\n",
            "i can relate to this so much it hurts i come from an upper middle class family and they re absolutely amazing i ve been lucky to have amazing friends as well i m at my dream school and i am achieving everything i ve ever wanted but i always feel like a screw up for feeling so unbearably sad all the time it makes me guilty because nothing in my life is going wrong but i m so sad and hurt all the time and i don t even understand why\n",
            "my husband went to a therapist once who questioned why he was there because on paper everything about his life was good took my husband a couple years before he would give therapy another try\n",
            "clinical depression isn t a character defect it s a medical condition with a biological reality however i commend you for maintaining gratitude despite your suffering some totally loose their sense of perspective when suffering depression\n",
            "i feel this so deeply it is like a vicious cycle i just end up torturing myself and then hating myself afterwards feeling so guilty about it life was not that hard but i ended up always being so miserable because of myself and my own decisions\n",
            "mine isn t i m suffering from being poor for seeing my mom vanishing for not being able to help to see lots of unpaid rent checks if i had that easy life ill seek people to help me unscrew it and live\n",
            "and you have no one else to blame but yourself which makes you feel like an even bigger failure especially if most of your depression is self inflicted\n",
            "damn me too my quality of life is objectively good compared to others but i still wanna die\n",
            "yep i used to wish i was a poor child in a third world community so that i wouldn t be squandering resources with my level of inadequacy\n",
            "same thing w bpd here the ability to screw your life is really exausting you look at the debris of your personality and the pain that you bring to others and cannot believe why or how on earth did you reach the same point again while everything looked like full of potentials for a positive outcome i only have myself to blame i i feel for you and i relate to your feelings disorders can really cripple you\n",
            "this is so relatable i understand that i have a good life i have a family and friends that undoubtedly care about me a love life good grades and i think that what makes me depressed the most is to have all these things but still feel depressed i think that hating yourself and not your life is a very complicated issue and it makes me fear that i will never be content with what i have\n",
            "i was like this for most of my life until the past couple years turns out it s not even my fault i just need medication because my heads not straight the whole time i thought i was just some spoiled brat who didn t deserve anything and now i m happy and normal like i never thought i d be all because of some medication i d encourage you to see a psychiatrist if this persists because it could change ur life like it did mine\n",

            "you will be able don t give up try using logic and pragmatic judgment to overcome your condition understand what triggers your sadness and apply countermeasures both psychological perspectives and material resources such as friends family inspirational sources at the end of the day depression its like carrying a big weight thus you face an impediment on walking forward the thing is that if you don t get used to movement you won t grow strong enough to move the weight with ease get it\n",

            "i let my ten year old stay home from school monday because he needed a mental health day i m watching him now for signs of depression and anxiety because my family has plenty of history of depression so mental health days when he s younger to help him realize hey i need a day to destress teenagers in general are not nice people you tell your friends that you re depressed and couldn t come to school they should understand anybody else they don t matter and the excuse i wrote for my kid child did not feel well please excuse his absence\n",
            "fuck yeah i completely agree it feels so difficult to say hi i won t be in today because my mind is completely caving in on me and forcing graphic and distressing images in my head constantly it s easier to say hey i have diarrhoea can t be in fuck\n",
            "this i m so fed up with lying all the time another good reason why i avoid people and never make an effort to befriend anyone one of the perks of having no friends is that you have no one who ll constantly be on your ass for skipping out on things\n",

            "you can maybe it s because my depression is atypical and functional but i talk about it pubicly all the time i know what logical fallacies my brain is prone to in this state because i know what parts it effects neurologically i know i m less well versed in reading emotions or a room so instead if keeping it in and spiralling i usually proclaim that i m suffering from depression right now and that if people have questions i m very willing to answer them and it helps because you realize almost everyone can relate and no one thinks it s that weird i think it s just one of those tricks depression plays on your mind it makes you feel like people think you re weirder than they actually think you are\n",
            "really late but i usually tell people other than family that i m depressed most people are fine with it and take it as a valid answer although the school wasn t too happy with me missing 15 weeks of school and tried to slap my parents with a 2000 fine although all my doctors stepped in and one legit told them to fuck off\n",
            "it s like walking on eggshells some people showed genuine concern and pieced it together i wasn t feeling or doing well mentally others just think that i am lazy or stuck up and made that clear sometimes i consider just saying the truth but i can t seem to get myself to do that it feels too personal or not a good enough of an excuse i know i would be doing this out of spite and feel like it s not worth it to get so worked up i just avoid telling most people about my depression and do my work elsewhere\n",
            "yesterday i just didn t have it in me to get out of bed and go to school so i made a lame excuse to my mom and then got yelled at for it at least i missed school tho\n",

            "amen to this you re spot on i m feeling the same way and it s like why not just put myself out of misery instead i don t want to have to endure years of trying to maybe fix myself when it seems like i ve hit a point of no return and i m completely broken\n",
            "hmm yeah i agree we all know what we can do to make things better but it is like we are just unable to do them for a while i tried forcing myself to do these things exercising walking in nature cooking healthy food for myself every day it didn t help i didn t enjoy anything it didn t make me feel any better it was like i couldn t feel pleasure at all and all it did was make me exhausted now i don t have the willpower to force myself anymore i just lie in bed listen to music watch youtube etc just like you i m scared of trying other things that might help because what if in the end nothing helps like the other things i tried before what if there s nothing left i d rather run away from reality i really hope we can find something that helps us take hold of our lives it s the only hope i cling to that one day i may find something i can actually do and not feel miserable and useless but i m not actively looking for it or anything i m just hanging on hoping that things will improve by themselves it s so frustrating to feel this way\n",
            "it s even worse when you do all those things and still don t get better\n",
            "whenever i do manage to do things my hatred for the way i did whatever it was kicks in immediately afterwards i cant stop picking apart what i said and how i moved and acted that s why i never do things unless i feel a cosmic force willing me to do something and even then it isn t enough to keep me from regretting what i did while doing whatever it was the universe wanted me so badly to do\n",
            "i ve spent nearly my whole life battling this mental illness and the most common advice i ve gotten is to motivate yourself to do positive things in one way or another i cannot motivate myself i ve tried and what little motivation i can muster dissipates in little to no time at all the only way i can do things is out of unhealthy obligation for example if i don t go to work every day i ll be homeless and hungry instead of doing something positive i try to avoid the biggest negative which feels like such a backwards way of thinking it only exacerbates my problems i ve been on anti depressants for half a year now and i find myself not feeling as miserable or numb but i m still nowhere near feeling normal it feels like it s too far away to grasp that feeling edit rephrased first sentence\n",
            "it can be worse i personally can function very well i wake up early in the morning i exercise religiously 5 times a week i est healthy and i have a decent body i have a job i make good money i drum i go on dates every so often i function almost like a normal human being but i m depressed i have no will to live everything bores me i want to kill myself every day despite doing all that stuff that should make my life worth living\n",
            "yes after a depressive episode i ll call my therapist for an appointment every time she asks where you been ummmmm in bed ahaha i laugh but it really isn t funny it s fucking awful i had a friend once say pick the low hanging fruit meaning just what you said go for a walk eat healthy see therapist etc i tried so hard to explain to her that yes i get it i want to so bad but my brain won t let me do a single healthy thing and then it lets me know what a total piece of shit i am for not doing those easy things then i sink lower then my brain tells me that i would be better off dead sink lower repeat i just came out of one i m feeling better we ve done some med adjustments and i hope to all that is holy and good that i ve got some good time ahead of depression free i wish the best for you i m so sorry you too have to fight this wicked disease love light\n",
            "my therapist as i was crying because i was slipping back into being unable to complete even basic tasks literally told me sometimes you just have to make yourself do stuff this professional advice is what i m paying 80 hr for i can t gary thats why i m here to figure out why i can t\n",
            "yes i always tell myself yes i can physically get to the gym or the mall or out to dinner or drinks bc i have a car and it can literally get me to those places but how do i get there it s so hard living like this my favorite part of the day is night time i get to sleep and not feel even if it s for a few hours my dreams are better than my reality\n",
            "i know exactly what you mean you feel like your frozen in place on the sofa no energy to move apart from scrolling reddit or watching tv and you need a drink the loo to do something but you have no motivation to move and you just sit there its insane and its happening to me right now i really am quite thristy right now but netflix is on i cannot feel like i can get up and do the things i should do by myself i have to visualise another version of myself pulling me up and then pushing me about to do things and it doesn t always work but i can almost feel the hands pulling and pushing me about if i pretend enough i feel like a stuck record\n",
            "definitely felt and still feel this went to therapy for almost a year sure felt okay ish but waking up every day was still hell before a couple people suggested medication first med absolute shit side effects after a day second med combo changed my fucking life you re just screaming in your head is this how normal people feel omg legitimately had coworkers remarking that i was smiling again i didn t even realize and while meds are not always the answer for me they were the catalyst to be able to begin to do the things i had no wanted to do and sometimes that nudge helps get the creaking wheels back into motion still have days where i m depressed as fuck but that s also more likely to happen if the day before i decided to sleep 6h later than usual eat junk skip exercising procrastinate on work etc etc etc and on the days where there is no cause my antidepressants almost always kick in 2h after i take them and i just almost magically and eerily get out of bed and sometimes doing that alone is a small step in the right direction of course that doesn t always happen like today have a huge list of things and things that will happen if i do them and yet i can t be bothered to do any of it long hard road ahead there and a lot of the time it doesn t feel worth it anhedonia doesn t help as my therapist told me the other day i want you to give yourself credit instead of me telling you to give yourself credit and we very often prefer to hyperfocus on all the things we could be doing that we aren t doing that others seem to have no trouble doing then ruminating on that they say do the gratitude thing but i hate it lol\n",
            "that s exactly the reason i did so bad in uni i was a law student and i actually liked to read do problem questions and write and i would sit at my computer and have no motivation at all now that it s died down a little i try to tell my family that it s way worse than how i m acting right now and they say stuff like i tried to help you and you didn t take my advice the thing is i did take their advice but i literally could not do it\n",
            "eating properly doesn t make me feel better i mean i m sure in the long run it might make a difference but the short term instant gratification of sweets and junk food is often too much to resist and it actually does make me feel better at the moment of consumption exercising i don t know it makes a small difference but it doesn t really solve my core problems hobbies might help i d like to draw more but as you ve mentioned motivation is a problem honestly having close friends to talk to on a regular basis would be the best thing for my mental health but i don t really have any right now but yeah i can 100 relate to the hopelessness bit i feel a bit hopeless about getting better although i am trying small steps i suppose\n",
            "big mood depression can trap you in a death spiral but it s important to try hard as it may be to remember that what you re feeling isn t caused by any character flaws or incompetence but rather caused by a serious medical condition\n",
            "i feel that the biggest problem with depression is how varied it is it can be ephemeral or lifelong triggered by events or simply part of our biology so what works for someone else might do the opposite for you regardless of all that we all know that inability to do anything the spiral is difficult to get out of putting it lightly there are these moments of clarity though where we can see ourselves and feel that desire to get out strongly it s those moments you grasp to and find the strength to keep on trying to get out you may never be free of it but you keep building up ways to combat it so you can take action or get the semblance of something better than this we re all in this together\n",

            "actually i just wrote something on similar lines a while ago i have been working out for the past six years the ostensible reason was to vent cuz of all the shyness but deep down i knew that it actually was a break from people world for an hour this was college and this was without adhering to a diet since corona i have combined it with a strict diet and i m making serious progress physically the developing core makes me feel really good in the mornings in addition to the hour s workout but the deal is mentally even then evening onwards depression hits just like it used to so this hobby actually gives a 2 hour temporary reprieve and nothing more one small yet pertinent change is that maybe my state of mind is mostly the same yet a small hope of seeing a better fitter sexier me the next day does reduce that why do i even exist line of thought but only a little\n",
            "i really feel this last fall my depression was the worst it had been in years i couldn t focus on anything very suicidal was starting to do poorly in all of my classes and was no longer being effective at helping others at my internship i ll spare you all the fluffy details but long story short i reluctantly decided to give medication another try after about a month i was feeling a little better after two i was feeling the best i had in over a year it was like something clicked in my brain and the things my therapist was telling me to do finally made sense it was like the medication helped reconnect whatever was off in my brain so that i had the energy and motivation to fight my own sick mind and start getting better things aren t perfect now and i still have bad days but my life has veeeery slowly gotten better op i m in no way trying to invalidate your experience i m really sorry that your school s counselor failed you i know medication definitely isn t for everyone and finding a doctor is hard i just wanted to share a bit of my story in the hopes of giving you even the tiniest glimmer of hope and motivation\n",

            "thank you so much for sharing this with us you re right it s so easy for someone to tell us from the perspective of someone who either doesn t have depression or has experienced situational depression rather than chronic that exercise helps we know exercise helps we do but if even just brushing your teeth is an all encompassing task how are we supposed to do that exercise this is what i wish a lot of doctors would understand\n",
            "my advice would be to start small try to do the dishes on time put away your laundry maintain your hygiene etc depression takes away all your energy abd all you want to do is rot in bed in my experience if you can get your body in motion by doing small achievable tasks you eventually build enough willpower to do bigger tasks\n",
            "ayup it s horrible also nobody really understands what causes it yet and knowing that would really impact how it s treated what a time to be depressed frankly i just hope i find a drug that helps me some day i despair of any sort of lifestyle advice i really do because it effectively individualises the problem and solution making me feel at fault if i can t follow it but that s literally what i need help with in the first place doing something good can only ever result in a temporary experience or feeling it is progress and meaning that a depressed person lacks a feeling for and that seems to be at the core both at the motivational and cognitive level of the disorder a treatment isn t worthy of that name if it doesn t address the core experience of the problem thanks for the post op i feel less alone often i blame myself for every day spent frozen unable to move my body alongside my thoughts for every smile painfully faked for every sisyphean action trying to lifestyle my way out of depression i m grateful that i did try all these things because my world has expanded through them but they re not going to fix me\n",
            "i ve not read through all the comments and as i start to write this i wonder if i will actually post this i m 48 years old i started struggling with depression when i was in the third grade i won t go back there my biggest aha moment was when i had gone through so much therapy some good some just okay and was just done i talked to my primary doctor and he said do you apologize for wearing glasses of course i don t and he went on to explain that i had a chemical imbalance he helped me with meds i had talked and talked to to so many people about my issues my depression has been an old friend a warm blanket it is familiar it is also an unbelievable struggle it draws you back i want to speak to those of you who are so much younger than my 48 years life is good it does get better talk about how you feel now is better that it was 20 years ago i can say to my friends i was in a bad place and they care your friends will too let me tell you i didn t think i would live to see my being married with an amazing son my life that i didn t think had meaning does now you will find your way promise the darkness will come and sometimes we welcome it just for a bit then we gain our strength and we fight it life is worth it if not for us for the ones that love us\n",
            "i suffer from r emotionalneglect this amongst others things has caused severe depression i ve seen many therapists since childhood now that i m an adult and am more involved in my own treatment i ve found that the gold standard type therapies don t work for me cbt dbt and mindfulness all feel invalidating there are other treatment approaches out there and one just has to research i had absolutely no idea that there was anything besides the gold standard i ve done group therapy and it s just not as tailored to each persons needs whether it be for anxiety depression abuse of any kind neglect ptsd you name it there is someone out there who specializes in it\n",
            "same dude even when i manage to make myself do exercise studying etc on a day when i break the streak i feel extra shitty because i was already doing something to make my life better and now i fucked this up\n",
            "this is so exact it s unreal i always thought to myself i get so fucking drawn out from life the simplest things are impossible to get all freshend up and go to to a group therapy was so unrealistic even real simple things like everyday shit i m shut down what is starting to work for me is taking advantage of any small gaps im not as out of it and try to do something in very small spurts and each time it s getting a bit easier but this was so spot on it hit home thought i was like going nuts do wish depression in any form on anyone god bless\n",

            "when you have a day when you feel like you can do something reach out to a medical professional the feeling of fatigue and struggle to do basic things in my case needs medicine to overcome caffeine only goes so far a lot of depression gets worse if untreated so be proactive while you can since things do take a lot of effort don t be hard on yourself surrender to the fact that you have this thing it s not your fault you have it and even if you did manage to do all of the outer things it s an inner issue walks meditation petting animals watching comedies eating well working out etc are all great advice but they don t make a dent in a chemical imbalance that s why it s important to reach out all it takes is a couple of phone calls with nice people who want to help start there you can even do that in bed another thing you can do in bed which i just started doing is the cognitive behavioral workbook for depression it s on amazon and it s pretty awesome so far aside from that journaling helps too just write all of these feelings and thoughts out as they show up you don t have to do it everyday or show anyone but it s good to get it out of the head and onto a page don t expect them to feel easy make you feel better or give you any pleasure just think of them as beneficial steps to take while you re stuck in a rough place a pen a book a blank notebook and a phone call those great first steps don t take much effort you can do them all with music playing and they may lead you to a more manageable place best of luck i m on the same journey\n",
            "this is anecdotal but you might find it useful idk i ve had severe depression since i was a kid i have a very strong genetic predisposition to it nothing has helped me more than psychedelics and stimulants i ve had pretty crippling depression for 15 years now and i can say nothing improved my life more than magic mushrooms and vyvanse long term depression damages your pre frontal cortex and hippocampus which can result in adhd like symptoms when i was at college i only slept 45 minutes a night because i couldnt focus on my work all i did was work 23 hours a day and sleep an hour just to not fail since getting my stimulant prescription i now regularly sleep 8 hours a night because i can actually function this helped me a lot no anti depressant or therapist could have helped me like this also magic mushrooms reminded me what it felt like to be happy for the first time in years i tripped once and since then i exercise got a job drink water stopped using any drugs at all i have hobbies like art and writing etc those two might not work for everyone nor would i reccomend everyone try psychedelics or stimulants but for me personally they helped a lot i used to be a blubbery alcoholic now im fit and healthy looking i care about my clothes and hygiene im able to socialize etc im still very depressed but im able to do much more than i was before and im very grateful for both of those substances\n",

            "this is absolutely 100 accurate i ve been to see a counsellor a few weeks back gotten homework to start on some kind of routine and whatnot but have i done it so far honestly no i ve done nothing but been too demotivated to do anything else and constantly being restless and worried about something it seems like a promising thing to start on and i know that i should but at the same time i can t bring myself to i just don t have the emotional mental capabilities to motivate myself to go start on it\n",
            "even if you do a lot of those things it can still hit you hard for me it s the loneliness i m friends with a lot of people but i don t have friends i hope that makes sense i also don t have a so to share things with so i just go through the motions even if i improve who i am it s kind of meaningless if i m going to be alone forever\n",

            "big time agree and big ups for recognizing the cycle of depression attacking what s necessary to stop it my eventual ticket out if this hell was driving a wedge in the cycle either at the motivation part or at the depression part i found it much more helpful to target the source itself mine was a dark childhood leading to cyclical thinking of hopeless self hatred so cognitive therapy was perfectly suited to my case exercise and eating right may hell to boost motivation as you rightly say but that should be a starting point to attacking the depressive root i hope you get a lock on your origin point soon too bud\n",
            "it s not just that even if you do find the will to do various things it s not necessarily some recipe where you immediately create a new mentality many many people have no response to things that everyone assumes are helpful so at that point you have to will yourself to do things which are not even helping you feel better so that at some unknown point in the future you might feel better\n",
            "it s so irrational and frustrating that i m physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk but i have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed you know realizing this was my first step towards improving my life and getting better not cured but better you ve got great insight and with that knowledge comes power you re brave beyond what those people parrying about those hackneyed slogans can ever fathom\n",
            "also it s funny that you can be lying in your bed and ne stressed as hell what i learned from reading about the neurobiology of depression is that it is mainly caused by stress found that enlightening never thought of that but it s so obvious i am personally trying to take little steps to stress my self less over all and to go back and make fruitful connections with the world again it s not done by tomorrow but if it means it s 3 4 years of work until back to normal i think it s totally worth it\n",
            "group therapy can be great i know the counsellor just told you what many might tell you but therapy actually sounds like the right choice idk where you live and whether it s affordable but getting better isn t as you re saying about knowing what to do and neither is therapy i mean to some degree it is but i ve been in group therapy for years and most people there were very smart and reflective they did understand their behaviour quite well therapy isn t about what you do but about why you do it i know you might feel like their advice was useless because you barelyanaged to go there but for me it helped a lot personally i only went to counselling when i had to redo an exam and i realized on my own i wouldn t get myself to study and then drop out of uni i needed to get close to failing completely before i could ask for help ultimately the only one who can change and heal you is yourself but others can help you a lot on that journey i think the biggest support from my group therapy to me was having regular appointments and also having other people there that fail just as much as you do it took at least 2 years but i got to the point where i actually want to make myself better and not just deal with whatever shit is hitting me right now i ve been in therapy for 4 years now and i ve gotten a lot better but i still fail regularly and it can be really hard to do anything i m not saying this to discourage anyone i ve definitely made a lot of progress overall i m just trying to say that the goal shouldn t be to just do all those things but doing it once you shouldn t say i m going to go outside for 30mins every day but rather today i m going outside for 30 mins and do the same thing tomorrow longtime goals and plans are very important but you have to start small don t expect too much of yourself but also know that in time you can make it\n",

            "the feeling of knowing what to do and having no energy motivation or will to do it is extremely frustrating i hate it i found creating a hype playlist helped it s helped me a majority of the time i use it but i struggle to even press the play button mine s full of japanese rock n pop\n",
            "i have been depressed many years many of them to the point of almost paralysis this is the best description i have read about the problem people say exercise helps ok what if i cannot get out of this chair if exercise helps why don t people that don t exercise get depressed i just stopped talking to people about it they mean well but they get mad if you don t follow their advice then they accuse you of laziness and willful behavior sometimes distracting my self helped me music is one even rapidly looking around helped creative things help too but only sometimes good luck to you\n",
            "i can totally relate i have a therapist that s great my psychiatrist closed his practice to work at the va i ve reached out to doctors whom flat out said i have too many scripts that what i ve had the last 10 years was malpractice i m lost sad have no will to get out of bed some days this weekend has been especially rough i lost daisy my yorkie after 12 years of unconditional love the dr i reached out to made me feel like i pop pills for the thrill of it my parents are boomers whom think depression anxiety can be fixed they want to just fix me i can t be fixed without the side i ve had\n",
            "wow this is so accurate to what i experience everyday but i could never articulate it like that depression really is awful good luck\n",
            "this is absolutely my experience too logically i know that doing things like exercise would help but i am actually unable to do anything except for lie in bed and stare at the ceiling sending good energy to you you re not alone\n",
            "i can tell you that even doing those things doesn t really do anything for depression at least for me i have forced myself into physical activity and going out and being in nature and some minor charity work and it distracts you momentarily tbh physical activity distracted me into feeling even more miserable about myself but after it s done you re back to square one i envy those people whose depression gets better by doing all that shit\n",
            "yes all of this side note uni counselors are awful i had one put in my record medication non compliance for stopping an antidepressant that made me suicidal without calling my psychiatrist first like i ve been at this for years i know how this works\n",
            "first off i agree with your post completely however i have to say that i know of several individuals that have wonderful lives and they did nothing to make that happen they just got lucky so although in most cases that statement is valid it is not an absolute i would also like to point out that it is humans who have made things unfair and unstable in life yet they want to make out like it is some outside meta physical forces causing all the horror and injustice in our society my trying to make things better is dependent on dealing with this one truth and of course you cannot change human behavior until they change it themselves so catch 22 all around i guess\n",
            "im just glad someone finally explained it well enough i applaud you for typing this out it made me feel less alone in a way i truly truly hope that one day you me and everyone else in this world struggling with depresssion feels happiness again one day a luxury that many take for granted\n",
            "no joke i finally made the choice to change from lexapro to zoloft after 2 years of constant nausea and slightly better feelings i told myself the nausea was worth at least some mental relief i had to agree with my doctor that i would go see yet another therapist in order to change medications i understand that s her job and of course therapy will never hurt but getting started is the last thing i m ready for i wish there was a button that set it all up for us insurance choosing the right therapist etc if someone could tell me when and where to go i would be set the anxiety that swirls around getting these things ready makes it nearly impossible to take the proper steps\n",
            "i started going to therapy after i realized that i couldn t fix myself on my own that it hadn t happened by now it never was going to so i needed to try something different it s helped my depression a lot but it s been about ten years now and i spent all weekend just thinking about all the things i wanted to get done around the house but not doing them the first steps are always the hardest and i have no other advice other than things will get better if you put one foot in front of the other advice that i sorely need often\n",
            "i also get into the existential crisis like i can t believe we work to live and that s it and the only solution to cure your boredom or depression is to keep working and feeding this machine i feel as long as i am busy then my problems go away but they come right back when i m not busy\n",

            "thanks for sharing and i ve experienced similar challenges at one point i was in a trance like state in bed about 20 hours a day figured either sleep or semi sleep was the best way to avoid reality and in a way time travel and i ve had multiple therapist some strict and logical while others were semi spiritual but i ve found it s really tough to find someone who will stop and really listen therapist usually are trained in one or two methods and see things that way recall a cognitive therapist tell me to replace negative thoughts with neutral or positive ones i agree that actually does work and i grew up learning a similar concept in tennis avoid negative talk like after making a mistake thinking i suck and replace it with sometimes i miss and i can get better or something and i do agree this can work and a lot better than one might assume then i told the therapist when i think it s like watching a movie it s not always in sentences there seems to me things that can work for different people so i did really give this cognitive thing a good try for a few weeks even though i don t follow this particular path i did learn a few things and hey being mindful is a good thing i ll share something that is helping me some and hope it might be some help for someone reading this also i ve borrowed from various areas and this is not coming from me i m no expert etc i try to remember to have gratitude for the day i can find something positive in my environment and if not i can cheat and think of my cat or dog in heaven and it opens my heart at least for a moment so then i m temporarily at least in a neutral state not negativity recently i heard or read someone smart who explained that emotions come from the body and we can use our mind to override and force ourselves to do things and yes i experience what i call the black hole that pulls me to bed and i want to lay down feeling so tired like i ran two marathons and just be there waiting for time to pass time will pass and the guilty will kick in or i ll find a way to temporarily distract myself with cleaning the house or music or a documentary avoid news omg another phrase that seemed to help me is action comes before motivation i always assumed you had to be feeling it before you do something whatever it is you choose to do just show up and do it even if you feel like crap and feel like you suck i ve discovered i can draw and draw for hours hey at least it passes the time but then again there are times i think drawing and cleaning the house every day is not a living hell but i still feel stuck but at least less stuck than laying in bed i struggle with all of this because of my personal history and over the years i have become isolated and after being alone for years and not having anyone that actually wants to hear your opinions or ideas i start to question if i exist i mean sure i can wear a social mask and small talk but i don t know how to explain it it s something like if i have an interesting to me thought and no one hears it does it really exist or matter lots of challenges depression and anxiety are invisible and most regular people assume your lazy etc personally i really struggle with motivation maybe not the best way to end but i do try and figure out what is going on deep inside am i like this from dysfunctional patterns from childhood genetic bad choices in life maybe after i lost my job in a way i wish i could be like the collective and eat sleep work and watch tv and feel fulfilled i m glad i found your post it s really tough to talk about this stuff and i ve noticed my family kind of would rather not hear my darkest thoughts just remembered i had a friend back in college and he was severely depressed and would refuse to hang out sometimes and i didn t get it i would really try to encourage him but not make him feel guilty years later when i experienced depression i understood where he was coming from\n",

            "hey op 10 years ago i went off to university as a 18 year old man child i barely knew my arse from my elbow and yet ofc i thought i knew alot more than i did fast forward 3 years and i graduated with barely a 2 1 and was already in the middle of a full onset depressive breakdown it took me nearly 3 years to make any sort of productive recovery and i spent probably the next 5 years piecing myself together to work out who i really was and what i really wanted from life the truth is alot of us to to study with a real lack of perspective or idea of why we are going there society has burdened us with the notion that going to uni will put us on the right track but i ve come to realise that uni really should be a place for maturer people to go and realise a passion interest that has been shaped by experience and a really concretised direction i think most young adults are completely unready for the demands of a largely independent research led discipline don t be so hard on yourself take stock of what you are good at and what you are interested in if you re just starting at university and you think it s a waste of time drop out and spend your time working out what it is you really want to do get out of the academic bubble and do some work meet more people who aren t just getting fucked up at student bars and club nights if you re just finishing university then consolidate the experiences you had and use it to teach yourself to be a better person no experience should be in vain instead learn from it there are so many of us who have trodden a similar path but there is so much scope for a better life away from that time yes alot of people recount their uni years as the greatest time of their life but there is so much that is sooooo much better than the uni years stay strong i hope this helps\n",

            "god this is so nice to hear i ve basically been in the exact same situation except my now ex boyfriend never accepted or acknowledge my depression as well as the fact his behaviour was contributing to it a lot i still feel so down knowing that he probably thinks i m just lazy and heading no where in life when i was in genuinely hospital a few months ago of which he did not visit me not even a call or text and we were still semi together just trying to remember i m not a bad person and that i can do this shit it s hard\n",
            "same situation here anxiety and depression made it impossible to me to study and so i failed in a lot classes most of them i just stopped going to the classes the feeling of being caged in this situation made me think about suicide a lot of times but in this semester i improved a lot and now i m more hopeful about my future hope you get well to good luck\n",

            "this is one of the greatest analogies about suicide that i have ever seen i completely feel it\n",
            "at my party i m hiding in the toilets and deciding whether or not i should go home early or stay until closing time so no one makes a fuss\n",
            "yep i d say this is a pretty accurate analogy specially now because it s getting harder and harder to keep myself distracted\n",
            "and you feel bad for not enjoying the night which quickly turns into a vicious cycle\n",
            "this is the best analogy of suicide i ve ever heard or read i totally understand i just know i can t take much more and my days are numbered i m ready to go home as i call it\n",
            "you can t leave because they re expecting you to stay but when the party s over people leave lights go out and you are all alone again like you ever felt that you belong anyway\n",
            "yeah pretty much throw in some guilt for not enjoying the party because clearly all your friends are having fun and the ones who aren t are dealing with it too so why shouldn t you also throw in alot of fake smiling and i m having fun i promise but you re really super miserable\n",
            "it s the worst when they obviously pick up on it and then everyone ignores you\n",
            "it s even worse when the other guests start criticizing your every move like they just want you to stay so they have someone to make fun of\n",
            "this is exactly how i feel right now everything around me seems to be going perfectly and all of my coworkers are laughing about something but i couldn t stop thinking of how easy it would be to drink some of the labs chemicals\n",
            "take silver for accurately describing the experience many of us unfortunately face hope you have a good or above average day today my friend stay hydrated too\n",
            "always had the same association also the ones who stay at the party are the ones who unfortunately suffer if you go but you can just finally go to sleep but parties are not a closed arena there is fluctuation people come and go and the music may change my party actually got quite funny because a person entered and now it s very very hard to leave\n",
            "yeah imagine being depressed at a terrible party watching your crush making out with some guy no amount of alcohol can help you cope with that\n",
            "socialize dammit how dare you not you hate us dont you are you unhappy here then just leave let us hate you we re are gonna talk so much shit one you becuase you cant be one of us thats what i hear when i try to leave a party or gathering be in verbally or mentally the passive aggressiveness is still there that i feel helluva lot of pressure with parties gatherings like no i dont want to be in a house 30mins away from my own with high drunk people who will barely remember my face in the morning orrrr people who only talk to me during parties like cool thanks dude or dudet i might feel slightly less socially awkward but the next day there is nothing but the hollowness inside of me due to your hollow ass interaction with me thanks bruh then begins party part 2 where you re invited but if you don t accept it everyone hooks you in on it and brings it up even if you give the generic i have work school kids illness etc becuase either you simply have obligations that cant be scheduled with another party or you just dont want to fucking go but if you fail to go congrats you ve been promoted to outcast fucking shit also this is mainly for the american culture as we are super fucking social to the point where is makes our neighboring countries uncomforable its good for social people and people with charisma and a hell hole for those who are looking just to live there lives and fulfill the obligations iot to maintain said lives\n",
            "this is the best analogy because everyone has been at a party they just don t want to be at you know like your so s friends party the friend you just don t care for you go to the party because your so is really happy you re there but you just don t want to be there the night continues to go on but that friend just keeps pushing your buttons making you want to leave even more because you re miserable but your so just tells you that their friend doesn t mean what they said you try to take it easy but they keep pushing that by the end of the night you resent your so for inviting you in the first place all this when you just wanted to make an appearance and leave\n",
            "what s it they doing that s so fun mindless talking i guess my brain doesn t get excited over chit chat so i withdraw from people\n",
            "a neverending party that i don t enjoy i think i know what my nightmare is going to be tonight\n",
            "thank you for posting this it s very accurate and helps me understand myself a bit better\n",
            "perfect analogy hope you can find the strength and courage not to stay at that party but find another that suits you better tell them you are t having fun and need a break flip the script on suicide depression hope it helps my friend\n",
            "i ve explained it to a few people in a similar but less visual way i explain that my suicidal ideation doesn t come from sadness it comes from apathy nothing is fun nothing matters it s like being alone in a dark room with no furniture tv computer phone books no anything to take your mind off the emptiness pretty quickly you just want to leave\n",
            "u describe it perfectly being around happy people when ur suicidal is like putting on a performance to an elite audience when you ve never acted before in your life somehow you become a professional over time though i hate it i m an enabler\n",
            "i definitely feel this some times i often got stuck at parties irl too back in the day and couldn t leave as i had no phone and couldn t drive now that you mention this as an analogy for being suicidal it hits so close to home i feel like i m waiting around for things to just get better and even trying to make things better but am met with fear and anxiety which leads to depression and anger there was a time i got stuck at a party because the guy who gave me a ride to the party ended up hooking up with this girl and they ditched me and went back to his place to smash leaving me stranded at the party i didn t end up leaving until the next morning i was literally one of the last people to leave even though i wanted to be the first and i was too anxious to just ask someone if they were leaving and if i could get a ride finally one of the last people offered me a ride and took me home they went like half an hour out of their way to take me home the reason i mention this is because i feel like in terms of suicidal thoughts i am the last one left at the party now my mom passed away from cancer when i was 12 then i lost my sister to a sudden heart attack when i was 22 and then at age 28 i lost my dad to cancer as well everyone has left the party and i m just stranded and alone only this time there s no one left to drive me home\n",
            "wow i really never looked it like that next time i ponder about it and hopefully if i m lucky i won t but depression has no rules and happeneds when the fuck it wants to thanks for your post the more i read the less alone i feel\n",
            "yup i ll add being the designated driver as well can t leave early because of that sense of obligation to others\n",
            "and then if you tell someone you wanna leave they call you ungrateful because you had everything you were invited to the party after all\n",
            "here are two songs by an artist called grouper which sorta describe this thing living room we are all at this ill fitting party busy pretending to relate and stuck stuck in a sad song\n",
            "very well put i d like to add that its like you re not even a part of the party just a deflating balloon in the corner that people walk by and give a gentle smack\n",
            "i can t believe how dead on this analogy is i am absolutely going to use this in future explanations i think essentially everyone can relate to being stuck at an event they really deeply aren t enjoying yet everyone else does and expects them to\n",
            "and then you walk into the kitchen and there are people with pale sweaty faces doing drugs they wanted to leave but already figured out there is no way so they just go as hard as they can then you walk into the bedroom and theres people fucking not just couples but your gentle neighbors respected teachers everyone in a big pile trying to fuck the pain away then theres the basement you dont go in there but you are told its like 4chan liveleaks and the darkweb in there you freak out and run to the balcony the people there say welcome to r depression we all want to leave but lets stay a little longer\n",
            "this is it i said to my therapist once about how it annoys me the stay in it for the people in your life if not for you then for them for so much of my life i ve done things for others when do i get to do something for myself\n",
            "and then the party guests tell you that you re choosing to dislike being at the party\n",
            "you would be a good writer i can tell that was a really good simile i m sorry that you feel that way though maybe you meet someone at the party and that person make you want to stay\n",
            "you hit the nail on the head with this one this is exactly how i feel\n",
            "i completely understand this pain i have attempted suicide before and sometimes i wish i would have been successful cant even kill myself correctly\n",
            "i was try to remember that the people at the party really love me and if i were to leave they be very sad whatever it takes man whatever it takes just keep going i love you brother sister\n",
            "this post has made me come to realize i don t feel the same i hope that s a good thing and i m unsubbing after this\n",
            "i know that i know how you feel because i was suicidal for most of my life but since i planned to kill myself for real almost 4 years ago things have actually gotten better while i am still technically stuck here i don t feel that way so much anymore i ve learned to enjoy the party a bit more i ve found some people who i share interests with i found the yummy snacks i changed the music to one i prefer and decided to set up a board game instead of trying to force awkward conversation and eventually whether we re ready or not the party ends for all of us i m sorry you re feeling so bad if you want i have some things that helped me along my journey books i ve read podcasts things i ve done i don t want to force it so let me know if you want\n",
            "just think about those parties where you stick around all night anxious and beside yourself the night goes on and on and your desperation peaks then at the end of the night you meet someone else like you someone who s vibing just like you are and you make a friend the night was mostly a wash for both of you but at the end you were seen by each other and all of a sudden you re validated that s what life is like hold on long enough and something seemingly insignificant will come around through serendipity to make you feel like a part of this world and when that happens you will know that it was worth it to hang around strength op if you are truly feeling suicidal say it out loud to someone anyone let it be known to keep yourself safe it s worth it\n",
            "hey man it s your life and you can check out if you want but try to remember that the parties just getting started even though you might not be having fun right now there s still some time to turn that frown upside down\n",
            "maybe you need to stop going out at night going to parties to get drunk and take drugs do something else with your life otherwise i don t understand your analogy at all i ve never had a problem leaving a party but i have felt suicidal before and i can guarantee you it s absolutely nowhere near as easy as being at a party you don t like that you can just leave if what you re trying to get at is that the people around you are giving shit advice or not helping at all maybe you haven t been clear with them enough it s hard to say the truth but you have to you know you have to\n",
            "yup this is me 100 always feels like life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial like breaks of happiness\n",
            "yes this happens to me often sometimes i can go from heavy depression to feeling really excited in the course of one day\n",
            "i have this with my self esteem i ll put some makeup on and feel great take a bunch of selfies stick them on social media and then by the evening i ll see them again and realise i look like a clown delete them and get all sad about how ugly i am it s a horrible rollercoaster\n",
            "yes i m starting to worry i have bipolar type 2 because my highs consist of procrastinating more important things by cleaning decorating starting a ton of projects spending money i don t have and then falling off the face of the earth for a week or so again\n",
            "i was pondering this today why do i need to feel motivation to do things is that a true requirement\n",
            "yes and it s so damn tiring this past week i was fine i was actually having an ok week at work which is rare on friday i was still fine came home from work made dinner then all of a sudden everything went dark i felt like shit again idk what happened but it did since friday i pretty much was just in bed and didn t feel like doing anything it fucking sucks\n",
            "yes and i always get a knack to do something and get super pumped but never go through with it\n",
            "usually 3 4 days and no clue what triggers it i ll wake up feeling motivated and happy each day it decreases slightly until day 3 or 4 and i crash hard the crappy feeling depression lasts a lot longer\n",
            "just couple days ago i was really excited to make chicken pasta all i had to do was to go to a nearby 7min walk store and prepare it i was all ready to go clothes on on the doorway when it hits me just deep deep unmotivated feeling well fuck it i will just order thai food instead havent prepared my food for a week now i just cant get it done and to be honest i am terrified i have lived alone for a month now first 3 weeks were fine and i were excited to cook and clean and now im in a deep hole again and my apartments a mess and i cant get anything done i am afraid of myself at this point\n",
            "this happens to me all the time i get a huge burst of happiness that lasts for typically a couple days only to then be at my lowest point right after it s like a light switch one second i m happy the other i m not these surges of happiness are getting further and further apart unfortunately thankfully i m currently going through one of these happy surges but i m expecting to be thrown back down to rock bottom come tomorrow at least i m bracing for it\n",
            "yeah literally almost everyday i get this feeling that i m finally gonna get it together and then it all comes crashing down it makes it harder to feel like i should get back up and try again because it s just hurts more every time when i experience happiness the only thing in my mind is that it s not going to last long and it never does i have some friends who i go to for help but i treat them so badly because i have trust issues and i say sorry every time and i certainly am sorry but i always seem to mess up again and i constantly feel like a burden to them that they don t want around my mind comes up with these thoughts that they are always talking bad about me and doing stuff without me and i hate that i think that way about them i feel like i m broken like i ll never fit in with a friend group like i ll never experience beautiful relationships that other people do it s been a bad few days for me but what s calming down every so often is telling myself that it s okay to be alone even if i don t want to be\n",
            "all the time i could feel really motivated for about a week go to the gym everyday go outside hang with friends but the all of a sudden depression just hits me like a train then i start hating my self and flood my mind with suicidal thoughts all of a sudden i hate it\n",
            "all the fucking time and at this point these highs are starting to get shorter and shorter because i know that they won t last and that saddens me i d rather not have them at all tbh it feels like i m being teased with a glimpse of a healthy mind and then it s just ripped away again overnight\n",
            "i was at a concert and gave a big ass smile about how much i love music but seconds later was bombarded with thoughts about how my being the worst person in the universe attributed to my being alone at a concert\n",
            "i used to feel like this before taking medication and going to therapy nowadays i do have good bad days but they don t happen without a reason like they used to\n",
            "usually something good happens in my life that makes life seem not so bad and so i have a sort of boost of energy but then a couple hours go by and i m back again also many lonely nights i sit up and think about what i could possibly do to help myself and then i end up thinking i found a way i get hyped like things will change for the better but then i never have the energy to actually help myself and so i fall back down and the cycle repeats boom\n",
            "like why do they have to end after a long while of just sadness it would be nice to just keep the energy up after an episode\n",
            "yeah i get manic episodes where i wanna clean the whole fucking house even when it s time to sleep and when it s gone i can t even put a dish in the dishwasher\n",
            "it comes in waves i will exercise run every day for a week or two then completely fall off the wagon its like a pendulum youre either completely motivated and energetic or your totally useless and lazy for me there is very little in between i feel you stay strong because that pendulum is swinging for a lot of us out there peace and love\n",
            "look up bipolar ii see if it sounds like u can appear v similar to depression had relative who judging of subsequent fam hx i think was misdiagnosed with depression and prescribed seroxat when they actually had this did not end well\n",
            "yes i start to think about all of these cool things i want to do and achieve and then later my mind is telling me that this is all just pointless and i ll never actually be happy\n",
            "all the time it s gotten to the point where i ve been wondering if i m bi polar but i can t take the time off work or dish out the money to get things figured out this saturday was great but it quickly dropped off saturday night and now i m back to full on despondency i booked a trip to the west coast for a few days and i m not even excited about it\n",
            "it s so hard being alive lately i was so motivated with some projects like pixelated plataform games i was going to develop some simple and funny game one of my dreams was to be a game dev anyway i worked on it for something like 4 days and gave up i wanted to be a digital artist illustrator and i draw for few minutes and stop because i can t draw as i wanted to even having some drawings i think i ll never be noticed i was working for something like 2 months and stopped because i was having anxiety crysis i was working because i wanted to have some nice stuffs to my house and help my husband with the bills my life happens around ups and downs all the time i m luckly married with such an awsome man that makes everything to make me happy he s depressed too like me but he s always pushing me up always when good things happens in my life i just feel apathetic i just know that something is good but can t feel anything good so it keeps myself down and it s hard to get motivated i feel that i m such a loser sometimes i have dreams and feelings and my dreams are just dreams and i ll not realize them this is how motivated i m right now and lately i m feeling like that 2 years almost 3 years now i m afraid that i ll expend my whole life being like that and doing nothing just being my husband s parasite\n",
            "i always spend the good times full of dread because i know i ll get too comfortable and it ll end\n",
            "yes my depression turned into me feeling like it s all getting better just for it in return to put me back in my spot i run away from it but it always catches up to me\n",
            "i do this past week was the best since i could last remember but then i fell of yesterday and it was very bad i cannot get out of my own head my thoughts are repetitive and self destructive\n",
            "all the time it s so damn frustrating because it affects my productivity at work and my school work\n",
            "yep usually when i have a sort of personal project i m working on then once it s over i m back to square one\n",
            "yes it goes up and down this year has been a huge downfall for me i m unmotivated 100 i feel ya i hope you are able to overcome this\n",
            "oh yea definitely at first i thought i had bipolar but i guess the lows happen way more often than the highs\n",
            "i m magically happy one day and stupid me always thinks wow so this is it the great depression is finally finished wake up the next day sike you thought\n",
            "yes this is me constantly i am okay for half a day and then it s like a roller coster and the smallest thing can set me off and i am back deep in the dark black hole i feel like i ve tried so many medications i ve been in the hospital several times i ve been to an amazing counsellor whom i can t now afford the 120 session cost i try to do things to make myself feel better journaling yoga colouring writing it just feels like the space between the bad times and good times are getting longer and more drawn out\n",
            "now to preface i am not any kind of licensed professional i had thins same thing happen to me i d go a few days feeling meh then hit like rock bottom for a week then i d get back up to meh the cycle kinda continued from there but long story short i was given a name for it bipolar 2 or just bipolar depression it makes you swing 90 degrees instead of 180 so you never get that high you just sometimes get meh\n",
            "i get this every week have one or two days feeling really motivated and energetic and then the rest of the week feeling really depressed\n",
            "yes its torture like life has to dangle just a tiny bit of normality and hope in front of me every now and again so that i never forget what it tastes like when its ripped away from me again cruel sick joke\n",
            "i ll have random breakdowns that will last for a hour and somtimes the whole day normally involves some crying it s getting pretty old at this point life has been kinda falling apart for the last 9 months not suicidal and never have been but the idea has started popping up somtimes what does sound very nice is sleeping sleeping for 15 hours a day and then working the rest nothing but sleep and work just so i can turn my brain life off for awhile until my career picks up\n",
            "yes i have plans made for the next day just to get them postponed until next week i hate it but i still choose to stay in bed and continue self loathing\n",
            "i can relate and it sucks on my highs i get so pumped up to do things so i make plans and schedule stuff and list everything i want to do i am actually hopeful and optimistic made too much but it will eventually die down after hours or minutes then i am left feeling empty again and i ll crawl back in my bed to do nothing then i ll feel guilty for doing nothing and shame myself for how much of a loser i am it s like life is playing a perpetual game on me where it gives me hope and takes it back as soon as i get it i always feel like life is mocking me\n",
            "oh 100 i m just coming down from a high sometimes it ll be like peaks during the day where something good might happen and i ll feel fine and then i ll crash but no matter what the happiness always feels so fake\n",
            "i take my my morning meds and drink my morning booze and then with that i go for my morning walk and buy food and more booze then i eat and sleep until evening because i m already exhausted by that point\n",
            "right now it s like 5pm and can t force myself to do anything because of a heart arrhythmia slept all night feel like total shit rn fucking sucks\n",
            "that s me most of the time sometimes i have fun doing stuff namely drinking but then it all goes to shit and i go back to longing for the grave\n",
            "yeah i get this alot specially i know i did not take my medication and i was thinking of being okay for the day and boom i be at my edge again thinking how worthless i am\n",
            "yes all the time i found what works bets for me is to keep myself busy with work but unfortunately that only takes me so far i m trying to read more and indulge in some hobbies but sometimes it seems like a lot of work if anyone has any suggestions i would really appreciate if\n",
            "i got super motivated last night at the worst possible time but now i m just back to my old deflated self i m a balloon with no air in\n",
            "everyday of my life except that i m falli g off the edge to rest for a few seconds to trip and fall immediately after\n",
            "yes for sure i ll have a couple of days or hours where i feel great and myself again and then all of the sudden it just gets evaporated and i m back to square one\n",
            "it s mind numbing to me how i can specifically recall times when my depression wasn t as bad times of comparative joy the latter half of 2007 august 2010 january august 2011 april september 2013 most of summer 2014 i actually can t remember any other times have i really been this down for four years\n",
            "yep wake up in the morning usually pretty good yet sometimes very tired by the time i get home from work i m good for about 2 3 hours where i get all these great ideas or get a lot of to do stuff done typically around 6 8pm i crash it s actually humorous how drastic and debilitating the turn around is usually it cripples me for a brief period then i smoke some weed and i m better again was really bad tonight from 8pm to now 10 pm at the time of posting this for example weed works wonders but i know it s just a temporary fix and i m really afraid of what i m gonna do without it\n",
            "oh heck ya sometimes are way worse than others and i hate when it happens because it truly isn t me i try push myself and fake it until i make it but the last couple of times i was to exhausted to fake it so i just warned everyone that i was not feeling myself and feeling very on edge so they could thread lightly around me lol\n",
            "i think it s pretty much the same for most of late teenagers and a pretty good amount of adults\n",
            "yeah this happens all the time for me except my motivation usually comes along when i can t sleep so like 2 3 am which is totally pointless and unhelpful\n",
            "sometimes it feels like that but i get happy and very talkative until everybody just thinks im annoying but i m fighting forthat battle to be myself\n",
            "absolutely and when i do fall off the edge it s into a huge pile of nails\n",
            "i usually fall off at night but yeah man it happens at least once a week\n",
            "yes we just gotta do what we can to stay in those highs i guess clean the house or go jogging no matter how pointless it seems\n",
            "it s a constant struggle of finding something to keep myself occupied until the numbness returns someday it ll all be over someday\n",
            "it happens to me often but i ve started to keep a journal of things i want to try and get done each day as long as i stay on top of the journal requirement i usually stay more motivated\n",
            "yes i just cleaned my whole house and got insanely organised and ready for the week ahead now i keep thinking i ll wake up tomorrow and it ll be gone and i ll crash back down i know it s coming\n",
            "yes after an okay day i ll suddenly start feeling like no you are kidding yourself it s not going to be okay it never been okay that feeling start attacking me even in my deep sleep i ll wake up freaking out and crying\n",
            "happens every time during those moments i feel as though i m finally improving and getting better but then it all goes downhill and i just feel like a failure again it feels like one big cycle\n",
            "i do get those many times which is why i try harder to minimise those periods i try to do thing that give me a sense of accomplishment to keep me motivated get more done at work hitting the gym etc saving money etc it s the dead periods where you sit back and wonder what did i do today so i try to give myself enough answers to satisfy my depressed side\n",
            "okay i honestly always feel like this the pills that i m on make me get like this\n",
            "happens to me often what s helped is getting out in the world and talking to people having authentic conversations reconnecting with old friends trying to make new friends finding a hobby and going for it even if it s for a few days going to the gym and might exercise might help i make music and even though it doesn t reach millions i keep going because i hope it ll inspire or influence one person in a positive manner music has saved me find your calling what are you passionate about what ignites a fire in you if necessary i d recommend finding a therapist near you so you can talk about what you re going through mental health is often stigmatized in this society but it s nothing to be ashamed of we all need a helping hand sometimes this journey of life is just what it is appreciate the good and the bad and keep your head up things will get better\n",
            "all the time my guy hell i ll be lucky to express actual genuine happiness that isn t the result of someone getting a fake smile or laugh from me just from how shit i feel even so i ve learned more and more how to feel out my own emotions and through that i ve experienced less rage and sorrow that could ve otherwise sent me into a far greater darkness then where i m at now constantly peace upon u and all of what u seek to do my friend\n",
            "well after my meds the highs are longer and the lows are bearable i have less suicide thoughts which is great those are usually a rabbit hole for me as i would constantly nag myself to do it ofc i felt bad\n",
            "every single day i just learn to deal just one inch at a time inches people inches\n",
            "yes in some days i am happy and i think everything can be solved but when i wake up the day after i feel like shit and everything appears to me even worse\n",
            "yesss i won t lie i get grateful when i have house good days i realize if i stay busy along with that mood my depression lessens a bit it s not until something triggers it it s so hard to explain\n",

            "i understand this to be clinical depression the lows are too low meds are important here they last days it lifts it returns for no apparent reason meds can help with faulty brain chemistry not enough serotonin norepinephrine dopamine take your pick talk therapy helps sort out and move on from traumatic or triggering events or environments nature v nurture\n",
            "yes sometimes i feel like i maybe have some kind of mild bipolar disorder because i have these phases of being very motivated i ll see a doctor in two days i never trusted them before and i have a little hope that i ll get maybe a diagnosis that would really help a lot to give my disorder a name\n",
            "it s crazy how fast my mood can switch for absolutely no known reason it s tiring and so madding i can be confident and happy and five minutes later feel like a looser and want to leave the situation i m in\n",

            "this happens to me all the time for 3weeks i felt fine i felt like myself but then i woke up this morning feeling totally opposite my greatest fear is that one day i wouldn t wake up because it would have just gotten too hard and i got too weak i wanna feel better and i want it to be for real and last\n",
            "yep it s when i m with people most of the time but then i get into a mood where i don t deserve anything and that i want to be alone mostly when i have a few beers not drunk honestly might be a form of bipolar or i m just a moody bitch i don t push my mood on anyone so i don t worry them i feel like a menace to anyone i do something and it backfires on me for no reason which is why i distant myself away from anyone it s a fucking curse\n",

            "i used to some times it would last for like a day or two then id go to school and kinda enjoy talking to my friends but then id know what was coming the void i like to think of it as a kinda cancer where sometimes it can go and never comeback but thats not too common and that alot of the time it comes back with a firmer grip on you but yes sometimes i do get motivated and want to do something before my mind catches up to me and the dread sets in i just want to be normal again\n",

            "protip counterintuitive as it may seem go take a beginner social dance class salsa swing etc after the corona outbreak cools down reason the average 1 hour dance class pairs up people in a circle and has you switch partners every 1 2 minutes each time you re able to say hi i m so so and they do likewise without any subtext flirtiness or awkwardness you re both in it together clumsy patient and helpful and for a very short time in each other s arms in a totally non sexualized way the warmth of close human contact without the hang ups and uncertainties of dating is almost miraculous if you ve been depressed or socially avoidant in a beginner class everyone is clumsy with no idea what the hell they re doing and so totally without judgement laughter comes easily and you get to be supportive of them as much as enjoying a novel situation without risk of harsh judgment of you truly this is by far the best most enjoyable easily available way i ve found to reconnect with human touch and close nurturing contact when you re feeling low isolated dejected or unloved no one goes there with an agenda except learning how to dance and have fun doing so plus getting out of your head and into your body for an hour feels phenomenal whether you like dance or not this really is an incredible way to wake up a hibernating side of yourself and plug back into some vitality and with most 1 hr classes at about 15 an absolute therapeutic bargain\n",

            "this may sound cruel but look for the comedy in things i fight depression regularly and i m a huge stand up comedy fan and it definitely helps me the darker the comedy the better when i read your title my therapist finally convinced me to start getting out of the house and this shit happens it genuinely made me tilt my head back and laugh out loud not because i hate you and want you to suffer but because it s ironic and truly is funny that s a line you d hear on a standup comedy stage it s painful and difficult and it sucks but somehow it s also hilarious\n",

            "i don t really leave my house either unless i have to go to work and i really hate leaving my house i get super paranoid depression is one of those things that people think they understand but nobody can understand it until they have it and in my opinion it never really goes away but it does get easier sometimes it s really hard but i think it does get easier the longer you have had it because you cope\n",
            "my therapist said this to me just know that everything you normally struggle with is going to be on steroids because of this shit ok he didn t say this shit but i put that in there for you it did help me to know that yes this is harder than normal the feelings of the increased difficulty are real and fact based and i m hoping all the best for you my friend we got this\n",

            "it s the same for me it s gotten to the point where days blend together asked me what i did last week tuesday and i ll probably be right by saying what i did yesterday it sucks i want to do and be so much more suicide seems like it s the only way to stop this cycle\n",
            "about 15 years ago i came home on a brutal winter night after a long day at work i changed out of my clothes looked at the clock and it was like 630 i dallied around for about a half hour before i asked myself wtf am i still awake for there was literally nothing i needed or wanted to do that evening so i decided to go to bed at around 7 i woke up after about four hours and probably didn t fall back asleep for the rest of the night it was then i realized there was no escape from my life however brief\n",
            "every evening i hope to die in my sleep i just can t take it anymore\n",
            "i knew i was really depressed when i even stopped looking forward to going to sleep i use to love sleeping and now to me sleeping just means i have to wake up\n",
            "everyday i feel like that i tell myself i never have to do today again today is one of those days even when i m on a sunny beach the brain can get in the way a lot\n",
            "no way i stay up as long as possible the night is my only freedom and i always wake up with terrible nausea inducing anxiety\n",
            "sleeping is the most productive way i deal with depression i sometimes wake up and feel a bit better i totally get what you re saying\n",
            "i m not kidding try mushrooms it doesn t help everyone but i can teach you how to make tea and when it gets strong you stop it really helps me and a lot of others but it also carries risk just as any other medicine but much less side effects\n",
            "yeah that s where i m currently at previously i was still depressed but i was also off the rails and doing crazy shit now i have nothing to really distract me i never realized how effective of a bad coping habit it was until now so much shit was going on i felt fulfilled at the end of the day like fuck yeah i d think about all the bullshit i was dealing with when i closed my eyes and constantly how great death seemed but i also knew i m fucking living a life now i m a normal person doing normal shit and i m still depressed i do things that are good for me now i ve never been healthier in practice but i ve never been more depressed i genuinely think i m depressed because i ve been walking the narrow line like i ve taken everybody s advice and it fucked me by turning me into a fucking potato with eyes that requires food drink room and board and busy work to keep it from jumping into boiling grease and disturbing the other potatoes i just need a hectic life changing adventure every weekend but like that shit can go sideways and my social anxiety has always been so bad that i can t go out and do anything without wearing a blank face guise unless i m under the influence benzos if it s a choice but all i care about is functioning and there are a lot of drugs that remove anxiety through different methods i legit need medication and i m prescribed it now but i have to see my psychiatrist for a refill and since the pandemic started i have to do it by video call which makes me even more anxious so i just haven t so i just can t do anything wow i should start taking my meds again at least you have an impact on other people lol i wouldn t have written this if you hadn t made a post that s something that helps me anyways knowing that i have a positive effect on some people definitely not my family though lol but yeah you ve got that a pile of dust just gives you allergies you affect the world around you i d focus on making changes to your life that emphasize this i d also do a bunch of stupid shit other people wouldn t so take some salt with my rant and two cents\n",
            "this is motivating me to only do things that bring me joy life s too short fuck the fact that we go to jobs we hate and have to be a certain way for other people i wish it was simple and we could just do things that bring us joy\n",
            "yea i feel that completely thats the only time i get tol really relax trying to look ok normal is just exhausting even then though i never can theres always a thought you don t deserve it you re lazy you re useless stop being so emotional i just feel like its my fault i feel alone\n",
            "same that cycle hurts me either but life is a debt i need to pay which is precious thought suicide many times but death will eventually pay a visit maybe unexpectedly maybe when you are old don t visit that guest until he comes you can play a game which you build your character by reading exercising etc doesn t matter just doing something would make your character better than previous second that s how i stick to life don t waste an experience which you can only live just once whether you want more or not\n",
            "i want the day to end but then i dread that i have to begin the next day even fridays i think about mondays\n",
            "i ve been there i don t necessarily feel that way anymore but i don t feel like i m living my life to it s fullest\n",
            "i feel you man i m stuck studying subjects i don t really want to anymore and everyday spent doing that is a chore i really want to convince my parents to let me study a subject that i want in a college that i want if that doesn t fall through i will literally die\n",
            "wow hurts a lot to realize this is true except i often wake up in the middle of the night and that s when thoughts are darkest but yes every day feels like a wait out the clock situation\n",
            "coming home and laying in bed at the end of the day is the only thing i look forward to lately\n",
            "i relate since this feeling of getting through one day at a time is magnified by the pandemic and i in my own reasons continue to live to meet expectations and try not to break my parents heart it s like a prison of my own making you could just turn it all of right now or anytime but you can t so you just let the sands of time take you away in perpetual suffering\n",
            "all we have is time somedays im so focused i think time doesn t even exist or affect me because literally i have nothing on my agenda i mean i have an appointment tomorrow for covid but after that i m free free fallin like the song says\n",
            "honestly when i think it makes me not even want to get out of bed even on my days off from work i just think is the day really worth getting up for and a lot of the time i feel like it s not and then i sleep for 16 hours\n",
            "yep i just wait for the end of the day so i can have a few drinks and then sleep rinse and repeat and you have my weeks its sad\n",
            "yeah me too i ve stopped drinking my beloved coffee because i have to reason to be kept awake or alert that s when i knew i was messed up\n",
            "it s worse when it advances to a degree wherein you no longer care for the day to start and begin spending literally days in a row tucked in staring into either the ceiling or your phone s screen make sure you don t reach this level\n",
            "even when i m having a good day the best part of my day is climbing into bed at the end of the day this is especially so when i m having a bad day the relief is like a cold glass of water on a hot day night is the brief respite when the world doesn t expect or want something from me\n",
            "yes it makes sense at least from how i understood it when i wake up my goal in life is to male it just till lunch then dinner then sleep is soo close i can go to bed early to scroll till i m scrambled enough to fall asleep and repeat this cycle a coma would be more acceptable worst part to me is not feeling suicidal just a numb bio mass waiting to not be here anymore\n",
            "i can so relate to this everyday i just want the day to end never ending really night time is the time i m looking forward to the most because i just can t wait to sleep and forget everything about this world and life\n",
            "yes i wake up exhausted even though i sleep like 12 hours a night work for 8 hours then come home even more exhausted and totally mentally drained and i look forward to eating my nightly dessert sweet the entire day from the time i wake up i have a problem i know like that s literally the only thing that gets me through the day and makes me happy but then after i eat that i feel so satisfied but also like absolute shit and i just want to go right to bed it s like i can barely keep myself awake no energy to do anything no motivation just want to sleep this is not living not even close and it makes me even more depressed that i am wasting my youth doing nothing and sleeping all the time\n",
            "so true i get up everyday to rinse repeat but right at this time i can relax no bill collectors calling dr etc also addiction over for today i just eant to own a tiny home all alone\n",
            "i feel you on this the last 2 years ish have just been me trying to get the hours to go by so i can try and go to sleep to skip a few hours just to do the same exact thing the next day i really feel meaningless\n",
            "the nights are the worst too all i want is the day to end and it takes me hours to fall asleep because my mind keeps racing\n",
            "the worst part of wishing the day away too is knowing the next day and the next day and the next day are going to be exactly the same\n",
            "i like going to sleep because that s when i don t feel anything for awhile then i wake up and hope the day ends fast so i can go back to sleep\n",
            "the best part is when you have insomnia so bed time isn t even a release\n",
            "that makes total sense i ve felt the same way for a little over 32 years\n",
            "that s how most days are for me i get through them because they always feel like a struggle or a battle evenings and sleep are a respite and i look forward to both nearly every day\n",
            "i think i get what you re saying it is tough just living to get to bed and waking up waiting for the day to end nevertheless i really do hope you are still here\n",
            "i have battled some deep depression coming from some extremely unbelievably traumatic bullshit you want to know the best part of the deepest depths of depression hitting rock bottom means you know shit is going to get better eventually because of that i have learned to love the depths of despair\n",
            "ending the cycle is a feeling i think a lot of people feel i myself during my depressive episodes give myself that exact arguement\n",
            "complete opposite for me at night i m forced to be still with my thoughts and i can t wait for day time i m much less depressed during the day\n",
            "it s such a relief at the end of the day it s over and get to go to sleep tune everything out\n",
            "i can relate i just try to get through work and then come home and try to sleep which never works out because i have anxiety and insomnia\n",
            "totally agree only reason i like to go to work is because im forced to do something else for 8 hours a day and i dont have to think about anything besides work after that im alone with my thoughts and i enter the depression positive feedback loop until i fall asleep\n",
            "yes sleep is the greatest escape i have these days but then sometimes i get insomnia and can t access it the worst\n",
            "i really love sleeping and also dreaming while asleep it s like i m in a totally different world and i love it i love also how vivid some of my dreams are\n",
            "during the day i m so goddamn tired i want to sleep and people helping me by telling me i should go to bed early in the evening okay finally let s go to bed so tired me 2am why the fuck can t i sleep fml\n",
            "wish i could sleep but i cant sleep until 5 6am due to which i cant get up early for work which suck i hate life n depression i think i need to consult to good therapist coz i feel suicidal thoughts alot unable to focus on work too\n",
            "my wife left me exactly a week ago today and i ve only slept about 2 hours a night because i m not used to being without her next to me i m falling into a deep deep deep depression i feel like i have nobody i feel empty and shattered all i want is sleep eternally if possible\n",
            "yuuup i just woke up not too long ago and i just want to go back to sleep already\n",
            "or sometimes you just don t feel like falling asleep however tired you are because waking up to the idea that you have to face reality again hurts so much it cant be described in words alone\n",
            "yep i m at work now with that overwhelming general fatigue that depression brings on it s all i can do to keep my head up and complete tasks no less engage in the lively discussions around me i want to go to bed for a thousand years and wake up in another lifetime free of exhaustion and robots lots of robots\n",
            "it isn t that i want to sleep it s that i dont want to wake up\n",
            "i only sleep 2 4 hours each night that s hell because days last twice as long i wish i could sleep some days away but i can t that s the funny thing about depression it manifests in so many ways for us it s opposite i am even on ambien and clonazepam does not work for sleep for me at all\n",
            "yup i sleep like 80 of my day away then i m awake at night because i feel more at peace with myself when i m all alone in the world and the only people i feel connected with are awake when it s my night time\n",
            "i used to love sleeping the day continued and it felt like a safe haven but then you get those dreams you know the ones that make feel all warm and fuzzy and nostalgic instead of relishing those few precious memories it just hurts badly you re just reminded of what s gone and will never return when it comes down to sleeping truthfully i dread each night\n",
            "yes sleep is the only relief right now i wake up in the night crying take more benadryl wake up crying again i keep hoping i will wake up and things will be normal again but each time the reality of the situation just hits harder\n",
            "i absolutely love sleeping i dread falling asleep i have real trouble falling asleep even with pills and my mind is up to some really dumb shit when i m in that half sleep phase hearing noises feeling something touch pull me etc the worst thing about it all is that you know the relaxing part of the day is over and you ll have to get up in the morning it s the last step before the torturous feeling of waking up which is bollocks\n",
            "i m conflicted because sleeping is so fucking awesome but i have nightmares almost every night\n",
            "i d love to just curl up into a ball and sleep and sleep and sleep however i have a small person who is dependent on me to get up and do stuff for her during the day so sleeping is not an option\n",
            "sleep for hours wake up to sleep more sleep so much that you blur the lines between reality and dreams this would be great if it weren t for the responsibilities i ve been trying to escape\n",
            "if someone gave me sleeping pills or some kind of pills to die i would gladly eat it but it should give me immediate death otherwise i dont want to be a burden on my parents\n",
            "i do not really like to sleep is like i m wasting time but is better that be awake\n",

            "i drink way too much probably about once a week and then lay in bed all day the next day with a hangover part of me doesn t care because i get to do one of the only things i enjoy listen to podcasts and just sleep and sleep still groggy on monday though\n",
            "sleep rules i often put on a dsbm playlist on youtube and lay down for hours\n",
            "i ve been struggling with my depression lately and just can t seem to escape the thing that is keeping me down what i have realised in the last few weeks is that if i m not happy i can change that something i didn t think before i buy myself something new online or i go for that cup of coffee by myself hop on a bus and go off for the day or simply netflix and chill we only get one life and i m damed if i m leaving saying i wish i d done more depression you won this round\n",
            "hell yeah now im in the military and enough free time to sleep is something i miss\n",
            "well yup i spent the entire day yesterday lying in my bed and i m doing the same thing right now felling like shit but i also don t want to get off bed\n",

            "yes sometimes i wake up in the morning and the only thing i m looking forward to is going to bed\n",

            "ambien zolpidem is the best except on times of stress i take all weekend days and nights just over taking so i don t wake up\n",
            "i slept for 14 hours friday night into saturday i felt horrible when i finally had to get up and go to work but the emotional weightlessness of being unconscious was too tempting to resist after about 10 hours i was just waking up intermittently full of anxiety and forcing myself to go back to sleep to put it all off a little longer indulging in depression sleep instead of staying active is when i know i m not doing well\n",
            "i haven t slept at night without meds for 15 years for some reason i can sleep fine when napping during the day but at night i absolutely cannot go to sleep without pretty much knocking myself out with a combination of meds that i perfected people ask if that s bad for me yeah it probably is but it s probably worse to just go without sleep try meditation massage deep breathing guided imagery etc yes i have no it doesn t work with my severe depression and anxiety not alone i am 100 on board with sleep medication and i will never ever judge anyone who chooses it as a solution to insomnia\n",

            "agreed but then i end up sleeping for 18 hours a day and then i m tired and miserable and awake all night if i m awake at night then i m miserably lonely and want to end myself really the best solution is to be in coma for the rest of my life no financial burdens no school no job just dreaming and almost complete emptiness death is too much commitment sleep isn t enough a coma is just right it s the goldilocks thing\n",

            "i don t sleep well but i d rather toss and turn in bed and wake up with a headache and dry mouth due to sleep apnea rather than be conscious and have to face the reality of my self imposed isolated and social anxiety that keeps me from having any sort of meaningful connection to another human being\n",
            "i sleep 14 hour when i can or more if i don t i have a hard time functioning life isn t that great and i d rather sleep then be a live i wake up and think hmm what can i do and if i don t have work usually the answer us nothing and i just get depressed cause i don t really seem to find joy in anything anymore\n",

            "someone once described sleep as death without the commitment i slept 14 hours the other day simply because i didn t want to deal with the bullshit i m dealing with on a daily basis i don t think i felt like actually dying but i wouldn t mind if it happened\n",
            "ah sleep my favourite activity when you dont have anything to do when you have waay too much to do that you feel overwhelmed when you cant decide what to do next when you want to do something you cant be bad at when you re exhausted and need a break when you desperately want to stop thinking for sometime when its afternoon and you re already exhausted so just a little nap when its evening and well i couldn t possibly get anytbing else done today so might as well give up when its morning and its not yet the last minute and its not like i ll feel any better by getting ready withouy rushing and of course when you just want to shut out everyone and everything and be left alone in peace for sometime without being judged or analysed or bothered not even by yourself btw i suffer from insomnia on many days cant get to sleep when i actually want need to\n",

            "being prescribed a stimulant is the only thing that keeps me from depression napping i used to be okay just being on cymbalta with my energy now it seems like no one drug can treat all my symptoms which is discouraging i m slipping back even though for a while i was doing great with having added an atypical antipsychotic it s like my body gets used to a drug and then is like nope this is not what you are meant to feel like the brain wants to go back to its natural equilibrium which is poorly managing serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine\n",
            "i love it when i get good dreams but it sucks to wake up to reality sleep is a nice escape if you don t have a job you are not able to perceive time as you sleep so it is like instant from the time you pass out to the time you wake up which sucks\n",

            "yes i ve been on mood stabilizers and they ve been helping it s really weird feeling myself transition from never wanting to do anything but sleep to starting to find sleep really annoying like i can start to feel the bars of the prison so to speak and i don t like them i have a long way to go but if you told me how i would be today when i started seeking help i wouldn t have believed you because when you are deep in that depressive space you can t feel anything beyond how painful being awake is\n",
            "yes but the more i sleep the worse i feel it s a bad cycle to get into\n",
            "i get the feeling but challenge yourself to get out of bed first goal sit up in bed 2nd goal legs over bed third goal feet plant on floor fourth goal stand up etc as soon as you reach each goal you can rest and get back into bed or reward yourself with a treat small chocolate etc\n",

            "as everyone else has said it s not insensitive or arrogant i m really extroverted and i love to talk and meet new people when my depression hit as a teenager and i saw a lot of things slowly crumble apart in front of my eyes i just started to lose trust and faith in people which made my depression and social anxiety a whole lot worst now thanks to a middle school friend that i reconnected with and a few other friends i ve slightly become the same person that i was a few years ago if not better i m continuing to grow and learn in the harsh process of life and that s where a lot of people tend to give up when they stop seeing the world in a different light they stop believing in the things will get better quotes and just hate everyone and everything i ve been there and i know that feeling that nothing will get better suicide and everything comes back into my mind i told the same friend yesterday that i was going to commit suicide back in february one of the hardest things to tell someone you know and i m pretty open to it with strangers you may feel like you re dead inside you may feel like a monotone and flat person but you can change it s all a matter of finding that right support reminding yourself to stay grounded and remember who you are and continue to grow as a person life isn t easy and stack depression on top of that it s a storm ready to come to shore honestly i ve realized that living with depression it s all about trying to keep it in check and fight against it it s hard i know i ve been battling with it for 8 years now and i ve finally started to really change and see everything differently we re all strangers here but we all understand the struggles in one sense or another i can just hope that you can get through that struggle of not seeing yourself as who you really are peace and one love have a good day\n",

            "the same has happened to me i used to have this vibrant loud don t give a fuck about what anyone says jersey confidence and my depression has turned me into a shell i can t even conduct interviews for my articles confidently anymore that used to be my favorite part of my job talking to new interesting people about their passions or news worthy events people used to really open up with me and i d have such great interviews now almost always someone raises an eyebrow at me or worse they sense my weakness and give me one worders or short sentences so now it s even affecting my career it makes me feel so hopeless\n",

            "good news you can practice modulating your voice again my voice turned very hard and monotone over the years from the emotional disconnect and insecurities i experienced but thankfully it s one of those behavioral things that are fairly easy to get over with just determination maybe it was a lot easier because i had ample practice working in a callcenter but it really wasn t a long time from consciously forcing myself to internalising it you may also think you sound silly but overdoing it while practicing still makes for more interesting conversation than with your speech monotonously slogging along rather have a quirky way of talking than an utterly forgettable one that makes it sound like you don t care about anything\n",
            "yeah same i hit a new low yesterday first time that i legitimately cried myself to sleep and guess what i m sure nobody around me cares i actually stopped to think about self harming but i had no idea and i don t like pain suicide is not an option for now i m just rotting\n",
            "oh my god i feel this in my fucking soul i feel like i used to be so confident and could talk to and get along with everyone now i feel insecure and uninteresting i m constantly in a battle between performing and withdrawing where i perform a version of myself i think the person i m speaking to would like me to be i e i don t have a unified or consistent personality or i withdraw from them entirely not speaking or making eye contact i feel like i don t know who i am ughhhh anyway just know that i and so many others totally empathise with what you re experiencing and despite how you re feeling you haven t lost who you are as life changes we change and identity loss and reformation is a major part of that depression unfortunately complicates rekindling that sense of self let s hope you and i find ourselves again soon best wishes\n",
            "shit i ve never related to anything more sometimes i just feel like i m a shell of who i used to be as well i have those moments when it s like i m just a spectator of my own life if that makes sense even in my own life where i m supposed to be the main character or something i m just there and i hate it\n",
            "you had a personality honestly i ve always felt like i didn t have any personality or anything of that sort at all like i was just standing in the corner all the time like people here and you can say things about yourself that you are like this or were like that and stuff but anytime i think of stuff like that like if someone asks me what i want or stuff i just go blank honestly like there s nothing that defines me as a person\n",
            "oh wow i think i understand what you mean here i am going through the same thing and i can give you a time scale of how badly it s progressed i went for an interview for a master thesis that i was really passionate about at the interview i was super confident and i think i had a fantastic interview i got accepted the first two weeks i had the same energy and then after that something just changed in me i m bipolar so i guess this is one of those oh fuck not this again moods as the weeks went by i just don t find myself being that confident or passionate the lab i work with involves a lot of interactions between different people here to get different perspectives ideas etc but here i am 10 weeks into this 20 week thesis afraid and not confident to talk to anyone not confident to speak up or voice my opinion i just wanna do my work here and head home i was hoping i could push this to do my phd here int this division i have a month to finish the phd application but i have no confidence in doing that either i feel like i haven t created a good impression here and i have fucked it up real bad to do something with my life i don t know who i am anymore\n",
            "this totally explains me i can be the life of the party i ve been told that people light up when i m around but depression and anxiety have turned me into a boring dull monotone person who i don t recognise i generally hate being around people and never know what to say but i know that s not the real me i guess this is why i can see someone and think that i d love to be friends with them but i know that they wouldn t want to be friends with me because they will most likely not see the real relaxed non depressed or stressed me\n",

            "i struggle with this too sometimes especially at work because i just feel like i can t be myself i ve dealt with depression for years but i do remember how much happier and spunky i used to be when i was younger i was still depressed but i had my moments around friends now i just feel like a sad lame adult trying to dig myself out of this ditch it s stressful but we re all a work in progress i hope you can find yourself again i try to do things that bring me joy or make me feel good about myself it s not until i have those feelings that i realize how joyless i am and how i may appear to certain people but you got this i believe in you\n",
            "i relate so thank you for sharing my mood fluctuates a lot sometimes with no triggers and i feel that i can t rely on my personality like i don t know how i will be one day to the next so i am reluctant to make plans more than a week out i hope this passes for you soon and that your true personality can come through even if it s just for a little bit to remind you of who you are hang in there you are not alone\n",

            "no it hasn t stolen it it has covered it and that is an important distinction what does that mean it means it is temporary constantly temporary the trick is finding how to take the cover off it s like a mask you love you can t throw it away you were born with it it has sentimental value it s who you are spoiler no it isn t the real question is how do you get naked in front of a crowd of people it s not hard you just have to accept that you are ugly and people will love you for it or they won t but does it really matter if they don t you are on a stage in the spotlight of an empty theatre you can get naked because no one is there who doesn t care everyone in the audience has already seen you naked and if they haven t they will leave if they don t like it you are sailing your own ship you can listen to the siren s song and crash into the rocks or you can pull an odysseus and pass by it and go home it doesn t matter your ship will come to port eventually the question is where is home where the heart is here there or is it where you build it i hope you make it home\n",
            "i feel the same and it s really sad and confusing to lose what makes you you and regress into someone who doesn t even want to make an effort to be social anymore some days i fell good and i can be outgoing but mostly i m just a zombie and don t talk to anyone i haven t even made a single friend in a few years\n",

            "misery loves company so i m not going to share my own experience with this as many others have but i believe you 100 what i will share though is the only thing that has helped me deal with this in a way that doesn t require drugs small talk it sounds terrible but please hear read me out literally treat everyone like your neighbour that you kind of see sometimes and are on good terms with you are not afraid of your neighbour hopefully as they are familiar every time you interact with someone throughout the day at a store or drive thru or literally anywhere just try as hard as possible to see them as your neighbour and make small talk keep making an effort capitalized because i struggle with effort so idk maybe others do to to do this and you ll eventually be making casual conversation with people for very short periods of time throughout the day with no risk to yourself that can trigger anxiety this has helped me try to jackhammer my personality back out from its tomb very small pieces at a time and i sincerely hope you ll give it a try\n",
            "i feel you op normally i was the life of the party i had tons of friends tons of people to hang around with but once they see you in your moment of vulnerability only a few real ones stick i hate it when i start feeling depressed it just eats me i kind of messed up a group outing that was planned by my brother and a few friend of ours i told him that i didn t want to go and i just wanted to sleep now they re all not going they kind of made side comments about it too i hate that part of me it s like i m prone to screwing tons of things up just because of this stupid illness i just hope things work out for you op and no this doesn t sound insensitive much love op\n",
            "i relate to this so much over a year ago my personality was much more expressive and vibrant i don t feel any of it anymore occasionally it ll shine through but most of the time it just feels like there is a dense fog in my brain that hinders my personality from revealing itself i feel exactly as you said like a shell hollow i feel like others perceive me as boring and dismissible i try to engage in conversation and try to force myself to be more expressive it just feels so fake and gray i miss old me\n",
            "i can relate to this in so many ways my brother killed himself in 2010 and i thought i was dealing okay but the last few years have shown me that i m not okay and really need help i ve been a daily pot smoker ever since honestly about 11 years now i feel lost and with no direction or idea what to do with myself or life i have always suffered from depression and social anxiety but have always been outgoing and funny lately i honest to god don t know who i even am i m not the independent doer i always used to be the weed is surely a part of the issue at this point for me and i m working on it hugs to you op you re definitely not alone i hope you re feeling better soon\n",
            "my personality isn t that fun in the first place so i figure it didn t change much\n",
            "coming from someone who feels exactly the same way and from someone who just watched my uncle pass this saturday from a long 5 year fight with als your comment is not insensitive it s honesty i seen family this weekend that i barely see once a year no one knows my feelings of depression and social anxiety so everyone took me as boring lonesome and taking his passing unreasonably hard it was not the time nor the place to have any sort of conversation about my feelings i don t like to talk about them and i push them aside most times unfortunately als takes you physically your mind is still sharp as it was before als it takes your ability to walk eat speak it takes away all of your independence but most of it is painful depression for me has taken away many things from me and countless others it may not take away my ability to eat walk or speak what little i do but mixed with anxiety it s a whole other level i do have hope that one day i will be able to return back to who i am who i remember i am but the outlook doesn t look good\n",
            "it s not arrogant but bipolar people also understand this feeling as heavy depression is one of the modes of bipolar it does the same thing to us so we feel exactly the same way as you do but you re right if you re one of the luckier bipolar folks it can be interrupted by moments of happiness or even calm transitionary periods the shell effect continues though regardless of the period you re in all mental illnesses have their challenges bipolar is arguably worse than having only depression but it s not a competition and it s unique to every individual as well just keep going that s all that people like us who are afflicted with mental illness can do try everything you can to get out of it do not turn your nose up at any possible solution no matter how stupid ineffective it sounds to you and more than likely you will beat your depression\n",
            "recently came to a sudden realization that i m still depressed some 13 years after a tragedy in my life here i thought i was over it or passed it it showed up in less obvious ways than normal thanks to my loving wife i am more aware of other ways depression manifests itself in my life with that being said i m tryin to make sure to be aware of these symptoms so i can better attack them to all of you who may stumble on my comment i will try to leave you with a bit of advice that seemed to help me in the beginning and now i view depression as an enemy the enemy depression attacks you by getting you alone first and foremost once your alone depression can simply leave you to your own devices and our wicked human minds do the rest it is a battle every day and the more i remind myself of this the better i am served personally dealing with depression my mindset is to kill the enemy depression whenever i feel any symptoms i do my best to fight them or find a trigger that makes you happy or realize life isnt that bad i call this being a warrior against depression i hope this helps and remember that life is beautiful now and forever even if in this moment it feels horrendous fight on my friends you can win\n",
            "i struggle with depression and all the things the op said i also have suicidal thoughts almost every day i have gone from being a drug addict to an inmate in prison i was released and have stayed out of trouble for the most part but life has been riddled with tradgedy lots of ups but mostly downs im 34 years old with no job extreme social anxiety depression most of my friends have either passed away ended up in prison or now want nothing to do with me i recently lost my house and went through a relapse then bakeracted and now live with my mother i got caught with marijuana and they took my license i don t like people any more because i dont like myself ive tried to change but cant i have such anxiety about social situations i avoid them all together i have nothing to be proud of nothing real anyways i feel like every time i get a job im singled out and bullied i hate my existence and cant wait to die i play scenarios of myself walking in front of a bus of truck and try to play it out in my head if i could have the guts to do it i would i am so pathetic i cant even kill myself right i am convinced that the people who are in my life right now would only benefit from my death the relationships ive had ended in nothing but tradgedy and in retrospect mostly my fault in my heart i just dont want to hurt anyone anymore and it seems like thats all i do i self destruct and the people mixed in my life carry the consequences of it i dont know if ill ever get better i dont know if ill ever really jump im front of a train but it seems like it has to be more peaceful than the torment i put myself through everyday\n",
            "this is exactly how i feel and the worst part is this is exactly the kind of person i never wanted to become and was sure i would never become nerdy introvert uncool quiet all would have been ok with me if only i knew for a fact that i was none of those and had demonstrable proof from my past it s like watching a ghastly suicide happen in slow motion and not being able to do anything about it\n",
            "reading of all of this people in the same situation is moving today i thought about my loss of personality and how good i used to be all day long i m stucked on a sofa since something like 8 hours i really wish to any of us to feel good and to get better i d like to say that this sub raised up my soul but i m still on suicidal mood\n",
            "i too feel like this my depression has fundamentally changed me even with it being managed by meds at times it has changed how i interact with others build relationships and think of myself and my future it 110 humbled me to the point where i needed to cut contact with many people in my life leaving only the few close friends and relationships i care about coming to terms with that slowly but surely maybe i ll learn to regain some of those personality traits at some point but if not i m content just trying to be a productive person the best i can be\n",
            "wow i don t think i could ve related better to a post on here before i have absolutely no exterior personality because my depression forces me to feel like i have nothing of worth to say i feel too anxious to say what i think and be fun and loud like my friends that s who i am inside loud and always telling jokes always bubbly i ve had depression from a very early age my therapist thinks it s from trauma and not just something i was born with it s effected me since day 1 that i was conscious of it even as a child i couldn t express myself like you i have a hard time keeping friends and i don t know how to socialize anymore i just cant but i want to\n",

            "i used to feel exactly the same way then when my depression was better medication and exercise the odd thing was i didn t become confident and loud and fun i learned that i was a shy and quiet person regardless but without the depression i could accept that those qualities are fine moreover the qualities can be attractive to some people there is nothing wrong with not wanting to go drinking and wanting to tend to my garden instead it was the depression and anxiety tricking me into believing that i needed to be a different type of person to be happy so i guess the point i am trying to make is my spark was there all the time i just didn t know how to see it depression and anxiety is a bastard i hope you find some way through it\n",
            "yes i know exactly what you mean depression changes your personality i know that first hand\n",

            "this is pretty much what happened to me i used to be outgoing and have tons of friends and could basically talk to anyone i was always smiling as well but because of depression and social anxiety i no longer smile i hate my smile i can only to talk family and a couple close friends that ive been with for years i feel the same way as you described aswell i dont think your being arrogant or insensitive as i act the same way\n",

            "i agree but it s almost as if i ve been depressed for so long that i ve completely forgotten who the real me is some days i m terrified i ll never go back to being the same like i ll just continue existing as this boring blob of a human being\n",

            "well this just sums up my theory that family is just group of selfish people i kinda understand you i don t know if i m depressed but i don t really want to live i don t have parents so i live with my grandmother and everyday she says how she wants to just leave me and say i m a bad student when i m actually good and when i said i don t want to live she said go to therapist you psycho and know i am searching for ways to be emontionless and it s kinda works outside but not at home well i wish you the best and i hope things will get better for you\n",

            "i m sorry to hear that i know how you feel and can relate and empathize with you my mom used to do this with her husband when i was in high school and make fun of me going to therapy it s a really shitty feeling because you want them to be a part of your support system when in reality sometimes they aren t but remember people do care and support you even if you don t see it or get it through the people you want to\n",

            "lotta comments on here you might not read this one but i ll give my two cents nonetheless i feel like our parents didn t grow up knowing how impactful depression and mental illness as whole really is they believe it s a mindset something that can be turned off if we really tried i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety as a junior in high school and my dad to this day tells me to keep my mind clear and to not think bad thoughts he wanted me to get off the anti depression pills as soon as possible were pretty well off i don t think money was the issue i ended up lying to my dad and therapist telling them that i m alright now i literally told my therapist that watching motivational videos on youtube is what brought me out of depression and he bought it i m not alright lol i m very sorry to hear that your mother joked about your depression our parents are supposed to be the ones who support us no matter what as well as be very focused on our wellbeing for them to treat your illness as a joke is horrible and it s obvious that she d feel horrible if you ended your life early i don t think my father did anything as bad as what your mother did but it can be said that both parents don t really understand depression and its effects quite possibly they may never understand from here you have two options i think first would be to separate yourself physically mentally emotionally from your mother hearing and knowing that she thinks like this is extremely detrimental towards your health and well being the second option is what i do pretend i m not depressed when i m with my family even if it means being fake as hell i try to put on a happy face whenver im with my family this can only be done if you have a strong support group who knows about your issues good friends of which i am so grateful to have the second option is best imo because you never know when you re gonna need help from someone this wasn t great advice sorry lol i hope you can figure this out and i m sorry again that this happened to you\n",

            "i relate to this on another level i absolutely dread being awake and waking up is nothing short of severely disappointing knowing that i have to get out of bed and go pretend i m good until i can get back into bed is so draining i find myself sleeping anywhere from 12 15 hours a day usually and it still never feels like enough\n",
            "no you are not a coward if it is cowardly not to kill yourself then would it make you brave if you did hell no if the act of suicide isn t considered brave then the act of not doing so can t be cowardly imo that s called being a human being it s in our instincts to avoid dying who would legitimately wanna kill themself without the assistance of depression or suicidal thoughts literally nobody anyone would be a coward if you said here s a gun do it i get suicidal thoughts too and i ve sobbed at the pain of living sobbed at the lasting pain that i would inflict on others because dealing with a death is absolutely horrible nobody ever gets over a death even if you think the loss of your life is not worth caring about people will care for a long time the fact that you are alive is brave you are putting other people s happiness above your pain and that isn t an easy think to do you are hurting you are struggling and this shit is hard for us if you are alive even though you are suicidal or struggle with depression that s so difficult and so brave you are not a coward we are not cowards we are capable of growth and someday we will not only be able to stay alive but actually want to be alive you are stronger and braver than you realize\n",

            "coming from someone who napped years of their life away and failed a suicide attempt it s hard to believe sometimes but things do get better and you get stronger depression can be a real bitch and hard as hell to climb out of so my advice would be to start small give yourself one small obtainable goal each day even something as simple as brush your teeth or take a shower which can even be hard when you are depressed then add on another small goal and do that each day or try doing something nice for someone else sometimes it makes you feel better like write a letter or drop a dollar on the sidewalk for some unsuspecting person to find make somebody cookies or some shit and get some sun even if you just sit there for a few mins close your eyes and breath in that awesome fucking sunshine check out some nature that shit s amazing and most importantly remember if you are still here on this earth you still have a purpose here so don t give up not everything makes sense while you re living it but some day it will\n",

            "i am sorry this happened to you i had a similar thing happen to me i was so hurt and sad but the person just didnt know how important it was for me have you ever tried a support group i am in therapy and have some friends that know about my depression but i think so far meeting up with people that know exactly how i feel because they deal with the same sickness is what helps me the most hang in there\n",
            "i ve experienced this before and it s absolutely the worst just know it s not a reflection on you maybe she was going through something personal still it s not right to no show last minute like that\n",

            "ouch i felt that i would focus on being proud for reaching out it is possible they are going through something too or they are selfish either way you look at it it s 100 not your fault they didn t show you did something difficult that took strength they did something easy that took no effort you re the lesson i take away from that short story matter of fact i just texted a friend to say hi i don t typically do that thank you for the inspiration\n",
            "you have my congratulations on even getting dressed i like to say i handle disappointment better than nothing to look forward to hope you treated yourself to a specialty coffee and a nice pastry since you were there anyway if they did not call to cancel or to apologize maybe give them a call or text to ask if they are okay i am finding a lot of people are struggling with what day it is as covid has just wrecked the normal rhythm of lots of people s lives thursday my friend was over and got a call asking her if she was still coming as she was about 1 2 hour late she s i thought we were doing that thursday\n",

            "if i m being dead serious fuck your friend they are not worth your time you did what you could and you should be proud of that like the other dude said what they did is on them not you you got up pushed through the pain and went somewhere you should be proud of yourself tone is hard to convey over text i m not being sarcastic i am genuinely proud of you and you should be proud of yourself i know it s easier said then done but try put your back into it and try as i say to everyone i don t know what you are going through i don t know what you ve been through i don t know what you ve done all i can do is give you encouraging words unfortunately if i knew you and i knew what you were going through i would do more but sadly i can t all i can say is i m proud of you i love you you should be proud of you you should love you what they did was massively fucked up even if they didn t mean it to be but that s on them not you be proud you got up got dressed and went out the door because all of us on this sub are proud of you and that s for a reason have an absolutely completely and utterly fucking phenomenal day you awesome sauce person lol but fr have an awesome day\n",
            "if she made no intentions of cancelling or flaking last minute which even then sucks but is at least courtesy i know it can be hard when we have few support systems available to us but know your worth keeping people like that as your nearest and dearest is the quickest way to begin questioning and devaluing your own worth as a person it can actually make you a toxic person due to mistrust and doubt in others i ve been a victim of this for far too long i put faith in friends and family to help me and support me and get me by and when they don t pull through i feel cheated disappointed angry sad and all kinds of things i d rather not feel towards someone i m generally favorable towards if you express that it upset you it s 50 50 they will be apologetic and understanding and try to make it up or diminish the importance of the meet up make it sound like it wasn t that big of a deal despite you wanting to meet up for support with your episode people that want to spend time with you don t shouldn t beat around the bush about it it s kinder to fake that they are looking at an empty calendar and telling you they don t have the time\n",

            "same thing happened to me twice in 1 week while i was trying to come out of a major depressive episode sent me right back in it s hard i think the worst part was my over reaction when neither of these people knew what i was dealing with the pages of texts of me unleashing on them for causing me pain i ll never hear from either of them again but oh well i ve shed my tears but you can t change the past it s not your fault or any reflection on you if someone can t at least send a text to cancel plans\n",

            "getting out and walking has saved my mental state i walk for 1 45 every day now regardless of rain or shine dark or light getting out and walking keeps my depression down its the one thing that just keeps me sane and for some reason it generates energy and helps me to stay enthusiastic about other things as well i m a bit like you i don t have any close friends and i have some family stuff to deal with as well so i can relate to that disappointment and dissatisfaction that you might have initially felt from your friend standing you up at the coffee shop i live in scotland so its almost unheard of for a bloke to invite another bloke for coffee but i dont drink alcohol and that makes it hard to make new friends as well although i ve really begun doing things that i can only really enjoy on my own and that has been massively liberating for me i ve began reading again and i play a lot of videogames so that keeps me entertained in a solitary way but i cannot stress enough how important long walks are to me for my mental and physical health you seem like a really emotionally mature lady who knows what she wants and knows what she doesn t want so its thrilling to read your post and see how your handling the situation that your in i m sorry that your marriage isnt working out i ve been in a relationship for over a decade and tbh we are really happy despite the pandemic and not having any friends to hang out with so i consider myself very fortunate in that regard but i ve had losses in my life as well and your right that it is a grieving process i wish you all the best for your future moving forward and i hope you stay active and keep getting out it s worked wonders for my mental health my physical health my sleep pattern and my motivation to do more\n",

            "yep it becomes your default resting state you can laugh at a joke but you immediately drop back down to being depressed what s worse this drop is even more depressing on top of being regularly depressed so part of dealing with depression is trying to not get depressed over being depressed only then can you chip away at the initial seed of depression\n",
            "i feel like more and more people think of being sad as being depressed you see more often people say they are depressed if a small bad thing happens to them like their team lost or they got a bad grade maybe as a joke but still this takes away the severity of depression depression isn t taken as serious as it should be by some\n",
            "i hate that too i always come back to the same realisation though unless you ve experienced depression you just don t get it because you can t get it normal sadness doesn t compare to depression and i think people get scared to think someone they love could be depressed suicidal is too much for some people to comprehend just a few experiences i have had i m glad you got a laugh in anything i can utilise to distract myself and bring some peace to my mind is worth it i was feeling bad about the fact i ve started playing sims again quite a lot but at this point i don t care it distracts me and gives me abit of escapism and light relief from a never ending month i seem to have been reliving for 13 months i hope you get through and your parents support you as much as they are capable of doing\n",

            "this happened to me just yesterday and was infuriating in part because my mom used that to rationalize why she thinks i m lying about suicidal thoughts as if one funny moment changes me entire outlook on life my mom is always saying things like it s nice to see you ve been feeling better as if you can see feelings when i laugh at a joke or manage to cook or exercise one day those are moments not patterns and even patterns don t necessarily mean depression is over either i m sorry your parents are saying that stuff to you it can be exhausting to have to explain mental illness to people when you re already going through it\n",
            "facts also depression laughter exists as well like when you re so depressed that you start laughing about your own misery or some things that are geniunley dumb difference is that it often turns into crying\n",

            "i m not black and won t ever understand what it is like however there are a couple of things i ve learnt in my short life that has helped me get through life being a queer person it s 2 30am so i m probably gonna not make sense so i apologise one thing i heard a lot when my country was deciding to have same sex marriage was your existence is radical you being alive is radical and should be celebrated you being here while most white americans finally realise what you have gone through all of your life must be exhausting but also is powerful you being here while police brutality is shown by media with no regard to how that impacts black people shows that you are resilient you existing during all of this is grand thing and shouldn t be underestimated if you need to take a break from things please do the one thing you need to worry about right now is you these events can actually cause trauma because the constant viewing of police brutality and the disgraceful acts of the police and the fear for your life and safety is traumatising and to add depression into that this period of time is very difficult for you allow yourself to be not okay or whatever feelings you are feeling and give yourself room to take care of yourself even if it s 10 minutes a day where you do something you enjoy anything to actively feel better is a really good thing or even 10 minutes to relax i heard of an app called liberate that is a meditation app for bipoc black indigenous people of colour it might help you doing something that helps you feel better is doing good in the world also the fact that you are talking about your feelings is a great first step also i hope that you know that if you need to talk about it or want resources that might help i can always help you you are and will always be enough\n",

            "hey dude or gal all your problems are very real no doubt about it they suck and would legitimately make anybody upset depression could be making it feel even worse it s an extra disease which doesn t even care about the rationality people can be super well off and still get it it likely makes all of these feelings far worse going into what i now see as despair cycles where you honestly look at all the problems that are very real and get overwhelmed with despair and can no longer happiness when in that state i ve found it s impossible to remember any joy i m convinced my whole life has been exclusively misery if possible try to remember to make note of next time you re not feeling like absolute shit make note of it as a moment which is real do it whenever you can make a mental note in those moments when depression hits and takes your real and significant problems where it doesn t let you experience the sensation of happiness and makes you believe all your happy moments were surely just self delusion to cope you might just remember that you made note of feeling good and have no reason to doubt yourself since you were quite clear on it even if you can t recall the sensation of feeling good at that moment it might at least help you not spiral so far into despair when these very real problems threaten to overwhelm you and make you believe your whole life is misery and only misery sometimes you can outsmart depressive cycles before they take your problems and only make you feel worse about them sinking you into misery your problems are real being sad about them is legit but you may be able to fight the sadness at least and retain some happiness sometimes it s finding it in the smallest things having access to the internet and maybe clean water is itself something that the wealthiest and most privileged of times past couldn t have hoped for in many ways even us schmucks who have to deal with this unequal world can have some parts which are quite lucky to get to experience and being able to find happiness in perspectives can help save you from extra avoidable pain on top of the unavoidable pain i m angry at a lot of bs in the world and still frequently sad at the realization of what dirt most of us are beneath the heels of some rich pampered inheritor assholes who run the world but avoiding those despair cycles where possible might save you from feeling how you felt when you made this post and might let you experience a bit more happiness\n",

            "thank you for writing this i come from an immigrant background non white and i have been sheltered for most of my life i am bipolar and have depression i grew up in a multicultural community but growing up i ve only had maybe just one black friend it was just the way my community was setup italian community with lots of eastern european immigrants and asians but not really any other ethnicities i only really started learning about black people and black culture when i actually started working with black colleagues in my early 30s and started making friends from work it s been a couple of years since then this is what i ve observed in terms of public spaces black and white are no longer segregated but in terms of our social lives we are growing up with mostly white people around me i have to say that it is a parallel universe our lives are so separated from each other that when our black brothers and sisters talk about their experiences and their pain it s hard for many white people to understand this because they ve never seen it in their lives the type of hardships that our black brothers and sisters face the level of crime and the blatant racism white people don t experience it so when many white people say they don t understand or shrug things off or turn a blind eye a lot of times it s because they really don t understand and i m not saying this to make excuses or justify bad things and it s not our black brothers and sisters responsibility to educate it s not our black brothers and sisters fault we live separate lives and they don t ever really meet my eyes were really opened when i saw the video of eric gardner i wept when i saw the video i couldn t believe it when i saw it having black friends helped me to see the bigger picture it made me understand this wasn t just a one time incident this happens all the time i wept when i learned about george floyd they treated him like he didn t matter i shake and cry when i think about him calling out for his mom and there was no one there to help you ve been suffering for a long time please don t despair people were blind but their eyes are starting to get opened many many really really do care around the world it s just our lives are so separate and segregated that people like me are having trouble crossing that gap but people s hearts have really been touched and melted and wounded i see it as an awakening the posting you wrote was so beautiful and it made me cry please write your experiences down post it on reddit create your own blog go on you tube and tell your story if you re not comfortable or don t feel safe about putting yourself out there write it under a pen name talk about your experiences and set it up as a narration instead of a face to face camera confession style storytelling people need to hear you you need to be heard please show us your soul just the way you are you write beautifully people need to see and hear you are you artistic your writing makes me think you are create art your own art and show it to the world whatever medium poetry song just regular postings even if it s just here on reddit please don t end your life please don t end your voice we need to hear you please keep posting\n",

            "i am not black and i haven t experianced the brutal affect racisim has on those it persecutes and i know i can t understand to a great extent how it feels to experiance racism i have read the news i have seen how the world is burning at every seam it stresses me the hell out and if it makes me suicidal and severely depressed without being hurt by experiancing rampant racism then i know this must be literal hell fire and brimstone for you i am truly sorry you don t deserve to suffer so much and endure so much pain you already have to deal with depression and anxiety on a daily basis your skin color shouldn t be a factor in your stability and recovery i understand how you stand with your mental health i ve been doing really bad lately and i know how it feels to not want to go on but this world needs you your family your friends and all the good people worth caring about appreciate you just being here you may not be doing the best and it worries those around you but they are worried about you because they want you to stay here with them they are not hurt by your issues and i bet they want to see you get better in the long term the world is honestly really shitty rn but try to remember that by staying here day by day the likelihood things will get better is increased and the liklihood you will be able to get better step by step also increases if you have access to in patient partial programs or out patient services i think i would give those a try i know you think it might hurt the people around you to utilize them but it would hurt them far more if you never got better and left their lives all together honestly i don t know the entirety of your situation so i m sorry if none of these are optional rn i ve been trying to take a lot of walks exercising listening to music and playing basketball at a local park to get my mind off of things lately to try to cope idk but they might help to try out if you can sometimes just throwing things at a wall until something sticks is your best option to get better i hope you could get something out of this i want you to know you are cared about and that i really hope you can make it through these times and get better you deserve it\n",
            "never give up hope dude one day you ll be telling your kids how you lived through the literal biggest civil rights movement in the history of our planet there will always be hate in this world but you can help inspire a new generation to keep on fighting for what s right\n",
            "hey i have been bullied for being from a 3rd world country you ll be fine just keep your head up and pray\n",
            "i know the world right now looks like it was taken from a chapter in the book of revelation but please know you deserve to be here you deserve a life worth living you deserve happiness and you deserve to be heard everything is heavy right now between what s going on and in life but please take care of yourself reach out for support and don t give up i know that sounds cliche the whole not giving up thing but it s true i find people with depression are the strongest people i have ever met you re a warrior and we can get through this together you re not alone sending all my love prayers and thoughts to you\n",
            "for not being enough for not being what the world wanted for failing myself at being the best for never getting anything good out of my own life for never letting myself rest or be human the kind of shit i ve heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self esteem sense of self worth voice and made into introvert because of the mentality of you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there i always saw the future as bleak tiresome and as more struggle this never really changed i m white but as a trans person i could ve written these words myself hearing so much negative energy towards a minority group you re a part of is so fucking exhausting i m really glad you re feeling better though 3 try not to overwhelm yourself with that type of media if you catch yourself feeling obligated to keep up with it all the human brain isn t designed to be impacted by that kind of stress over and over again\n",
            "i m so sorry you re feeling the way you re feeling i m sorry things are the way that they are how do you suggest we change it what do you think could be done to improve this situation\n",
            "i m white living in the hood while our cases are different i understand what it s like being looked at and hated just because of the color of your skin i came to america w the family as an immigrant and i ve been beat and hated despite having done no wrong to other people and i went to a largely black school for a time there s so much discrimination and hate in america it s just so awful and their hate makes you think they re right about you but pay them no heed and seek out your own happiness yolo and don t waste it on these p o s racists because that s what they want to see you fail\n",
            "i don t know if this will make you feel any better but for me it s hard to look at everything going on because i m right in the middle my mom is going to be deputized later this month and i m going into the national guard and as soon as training is done i ll be doing law enforcement as well i would never treat someone differently for how they look i ve worked as an armed security guard often times interchangeable with police on private properties and where they overflow to the street i deal a lot with rambunctious drunk night club goers many nights we re side by side police i have never had anything but an ounce of respect for the cops i ve worked with they all seem level headed and calm it s an amazing role to look up to that being said i know this reality includes many many more people including police who i would never call role models but i hope to lead a new generation of more understanding law enforcement i feel a special fire burn every time i see the same videos as all of you it s personal for me too because i could some day be asked to fill a position where my actions are critical for upholding equality human rights dignity and constitutional rights every time i see awful videos i hope to god i ll be on the front lines to stop them soon to be the one who steps out and prevents any more deaths\n",
            "reading this told me so many great things about your character it s clear to me that not only are you a compassionate resilient person who wants to see change in the world but you are intelligent and simply tired of the stupidity of others that affects those around you and rightly so it must be so hard when you are surrounded by people who spew hatred in your own backyard to believe what i m about to say but there truly are so many people in the world who stand with you as an ally we need people like you the world needs people like you\n",
            "i know how you re feeling i m south slavic but moved to austria 3 years ago i had to endure people telling me to gtfo off their country on a daily basis people called me and still call me a fucking immigrant and there is even a political party that wants to ban immigration as a whole i moved here completely legally and have all the required paperwork but that doesn t stop some people\n",
            "billions will be dead by 2030 no one realizes all these protests and the media its all being stirred up to create martial law they want us all in concentration camps and political prisons they already have a huge black population behind bars for nothing crimes i dont want to live in a world where saying something ends you up being water boarded for 16 hours a day for the rest of your life this is our future people dont get how bad its going to get we are all going to die in the next 5 or 10 years we will all be in torture camps or dead im trying to find a way to kms asap because im not ending up in those prisons\n",
            "my heart is with you i really feel for you being in a place where you feel so hurt from all the inequality and hatred that exists i wish i could say something but as far as the mental health goes im in a similar place its hard i just know that just being there for your mom must mean the world for her especially with racist thugs trying to spread their misery around just being able to exist in that environment is something to be proud of remind yourself each morning all the strength that you have and be proud of yourself i appreciate you just for not letting the hate consume you thats not something many people can do\n",
            "hey buddy a honky here i completely understand where you re coming from with feeling guilty for how you feel which is about as shitty as any trick that depression pulls on you at the end of the day you need to be primarily concerned with your own health which i know sounds and feels selfish but it truly is square one for being and healthy and productive on any level when i lose any grip i manage to establish and start to wildly ruminate about what others might think of me i always replay that little nugget from pre flight safety checks about what to do when those goddamn masks from springing out of the ceiling affix your own mask properly first before attempting to help anyone else take the time you need to rest and gather yourself anyone with half an empathetic cell in their body should recognize your need to recharge you should never feel guilty for your own existence on any level because truly none of us asked to be here but here we are your life matters my friend the overwhelming brutality and 1984 horseshit going on right now is waking a lot of people up i hope good luck to you and i hope you start believing in yourself again\n",
            "i m not black and will never understand what you re going through right now i can t even imagine how hard it is to process you have so much value so much to offer everyone around you i know you re tired but please don t give up you deserve so much better than how you ve been treated and i only hope that things will improve you are very very loved\n",
            "really feeling this today feeling so unappreciated by people who meant the world to me life s been so hard and i don t see it getting any better soon\n",
            "thought of suicide never really leaves my mind i won t do it but living doesn t seem worth it don t have anything nothing to give nowhere to go wish they d let people like me die in peace instead of condemning them to a life of pure misery\n",
            "i feel you it s kinda the same with me it feels like you are in video game with very low health and as soon as someone hurts you you die\n",
            "literally me today stating an unpaid internship literally the first day and im already thinking that just not living is probably better\n",
            "i also noticed it a week ago the teacher has mistaken me for a girl because of my long hair the whole class started laughing even though i know no one will remember this in two days i literally went through suicide plans that s not the first time that i think about this after an unfortunate situation like this and i hate this i hate this so much\n",
            "i wish that feeling wouldn t be so immediate and long lasting anything can just happen and tempt me to just ram my car into a wall\n"
